            h2 How are costs calculated?
            hr

      .row
        .col-md-8
          p.text-muted Costs are calculated based on three metrics:

          h3 Words

          p.light-font For each word in your project, excluding versions. The charge for words reflect costs for storage and network usage.

          h3 Modifications

          p.light-font Every modification done via editor or API gets counted (Excluding save missings, translation orders). This cost reflects the usage of locize and enables us to charge less in times you use locize less.

          h3 Downloads

          p.light-font Download of translations from our CDN to your users get accounted. This costs are only charged if you directly use the translations served from our CDN.

          h3 Private Downloads

          p.light-font Regular downloads are public. So those translations would be visible to public even during development. To avoid leaking confidation informations during development (eg. new features) you can use private publish options which only enables downloads using an API key - so the translations are not public accessible.


        .col-md-4
          p.text-muted Prices are graduated:

          p.light-font(style="margin-top: 20px;") There are no permanent big raises of costs which were introduced by having to switch to a bigger plan because your plan reached a limit or because you needed some feature that was locked behind a paywall.

          h3 What does this mean for you?

          ul.light-font
            li Never being forced to be auto upgraded from a $49 to a $199 plan just because you cross a limit (words, pageviews, languages, users) just marginally
              i  (your real usage would be around $50 - but the plan forces you to use the "large plan" starting at $199).

            li Never pay a bigger plan just because of that one feature you need most but was not included in your current plan

            li Costs are based on your projects size and success

            li Costs adapt to your usage: having months with less modifications (usage of locize app) you pay less

            li Costs grow slower the bigger your project gets

            li No limit on users

            li No limit on languages

            li All the features - no paywalls
