          p.light-font I18next was created in late 2011. It's older than most of the libraries you will use nowadays, including your main frontend tech (react, vue, ...).

          h3 Maturity

          p.light-font Based on how long i18next already is available open source, there is no real i18n case that could not be solved with i18next.

          h3 Extensibility

          p.light-font
            | i18next can be used in any javascript (and a few non-javascript - .net, elm, iOS, android, ruby, ...) environment, with any UI framework, with any i18n format, ... 
            a(href="https://www.i18next.com/overview/supported-frameworks", target="_blank") the possibilities are endless.

          h3 Richness

          p.light-font There is a plenty of features and possibilities you'll get with i18next compared to other regular 18n frameworks.

          p
            a(href="https://www.i18next.com/overview/comparison-to-others", target="_blank") Here you can find more information about why i18next is special.

          p The i18next community provided us with great feedback. Out of that response and our own experiences we learnt providing instrumentation for doing proper internationalization just is not enough.

          p Helping developers to get their applications translated is great - but there is more to it.
