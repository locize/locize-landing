<ul>
<li>User privacy and data protection are human rights</li>
<li>We have a duty of care to the people within our data</li>
<li>Data is a liability, it should only be collected and processed when absolutely necessary</li>
<li>We loathe spam as much as you do!</li>
<li>We will never sell, rent or otherwise distribute or make public your personal information</li>
</ul>
<h3>2 RELEVANT LEGISLATION</h3>
<p>Along with our business and internal computer systems, this website is designed to comply with the following national and international legislation with regards to data protection and user privacy:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents">UK Data Protection Act 1988 (DPA)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:31995L0046">EU Data Protection Directive 1995 (DPD)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG&amp;toc=OJ:L:2016:119:TOC">EU General Data Protection Regulation 2018 (GDPR)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712">Australian Privacy Act 1988 (APA)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>locize’s compliance with the above legislation, all of which are stringent in nature, means that locize is likely compliant with the data protection and user privacy legislation set out by many other countries and territories as well. If you are unsure about whether this site is compliant with your own country of residences specific data protection and user privacy legislation you should contact our data protection officer (details of whom can be found in section 9) for clarification.</p>
<h3>3 PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT LOCIZE COLLECTS AND WHY WE COLLECT IT</h3>
<h4>3.1 <a href="http://locize.com">locize.com</a> the website and the subdomains (<a href="http://blog.locize.com">blog.locize.com</a>, <a href="http://docs.locize.com">docs.locize.com</a>, <a href="http://faq.locize.com">faq.locize.com</a>)</h4>
<p>This website collects and uses personal information for the following reasons:</p>
<p>Like most websites, this site uses Google Analytics (GA) to track user interaction. We use this data to determine the number of people using our site, to better understand how they find and use our web pages and to see their journey through the website.</p>
<p>We consider Google Analytics to be a third party data processor (see section 6 below). GA is the only used third party data processor used on the website.</p>
<p>The website is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>, while the documentation is hosted on <a href="https://www.gitbook.com">gitbook</a>.</p>
<h4>3.2 Contact forms and email links</h4>
<p>Should you choose to contact us using a contact form on one of our pages or an email link like <a href="mailto:support@locize.com">this one</a>, none of the data that you supply will be stored by locize or passed to be processed by any of the third party data processors defined in section 6.0. Instead the data will be collated into an email and sent to us over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</a> (SMTP). Our SMTP servers are protected by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a> (sometimes known as SSL) meaning that the email content is encrypted using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA-2</a>, 256-bit cryptography before being sent across the internet. The email content is then decrypted by our local computers and devices.</p>
<h4>3.3 <a href="http://locize.io">locize.io</a> our online localization service</h4>
<p>Should you choose to signup for our localization service over at <a href="https://www.locize.io/register">locize.io</a> your choosen</p>
<ul>
<li>username</li>
<li>password</li>
<li>given name</li>
<li>last name</li>
<li>email address</li>
</ul>
<p>will be stored in our database. This information is used to identify you as a user and excluding username and password is passed to the third party data processors detailed below to provide additional service to you.</p>
<p>Your name will be shown only in private area of the service and is only available to you and other users contributing to the same localization project.</p>
<p>Should you wish to have your personal data deleted, please email us here using the email address that you used to sign up.</p>
<p>If you are under 16 years of age you MUST obtain parental consent before signing up to our service.</p>
<p>Third party data processors used (for details check section 6):</p>
<ul>
<li>gravatar</li>
<li>reCaptcha</li>
<li>intercom</li>
<li>stripe</li>
<li>rollbar</li>
</ul>
<h3>4 HOW WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>As detailed in section 3.3 above, if you signup to our service some personal information will be stored within our database. This is currently the only occasion where personal data will be stored on locize. This data is stored in an unidentifiable fashion; the storage of this data is done in a pseudonymous fashion meaning that the data would require additional processing using a separately stored ‘key’ before it could be used to identify an individual.</p>
<p>If not stated differently in section 3 and subsections we try to use pseudonymisation for all personal data stored.</p>
<h3>5 ABOUT THIS SERVICE’S SERVER</h3>
<p>If not stated differently in section 3 and subsections our services are hosted by Amazon (AWS), who employ their own security measures. AWS employs industry-recognized certifications and audits:</p>
<ul>
<li>PCI DSS Level 1</li>
<li>ISO 27001</li>
<li>FISMA Moderate</li>
<li>HIPAA</li>
<li>SAS 70 Type II</li>
</ul>
<p>locize and thus your data are hosted in Ireland by Amazon Web Services Inc., 410 Terry Avenue North, Seattle WA 98109, United States. Amazon also adopts stringent technical measures to protect your personal data. Amazon does not pass on your personal data to third parties unless this is necessary in order to perform the agreed services or if Amazon is required to do so by law or to comply with a valid and mandatory instruction issued by a government or regulatory authority. The data provided for this purpose are kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, Amazon may also store the information in countries outside the European Economic Area. Amazon will, however, take the necessary steps to ensure that an appropriate level of data protection is maintained. If Amazon sends your data to the United States, for example, additional measures are taken, such as concluding EU-compliant data transmission agreements with the data importer if this is necessary. Amazon participates in the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework.</p>
<p>The purpose of processing data is that Amazon enables us to use Amazon servers. We only store the data for as long as is necessary to achieve this purpose.</p>
<p>More information from Amazon about data protection is available at: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/eu-data-protection">https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/eu-data-protection</a>.</p>
<p>Their services and data centers have multiple layers of operational and physical security to ensure the integrity and safety of your data. You can read more about AWS security <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/">here</a>.</p>
<p>All traffic (transferral of files) between locize services and your browser is encrypted and delivered over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a>.</p>

<p>We use a number of third parties to process personal data on our behalf. These third parties have been carefully chosen and all of them comply with the legislation set out in section 2.0.</p>
<h4>6.1 Google Analytics</h4>
<p>Although Goggle Analytics (GA) records data such as your geographical location, device, internet browser and operating system, none of this information personally identifies you to us. GA also records your computer’s IP address which could be used to personally identify you but Google do not grant us access to this.</p>
