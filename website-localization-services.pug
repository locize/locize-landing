            h2 What is website localization
            p Website localization, in its most basic form, is the act of enhancing website content through language and flow in order to deliver the most beneficial and relevant experience for online-visitors. One of the key objectives is to keep the content's original intent. It should be the same as it was when the language was first created.
            br
            p Most people associate "localization" with "translation," but true website localization entails considerably more than merely displaying text in a new language. Continue reading to discover how to think about website localizationâ€”and how to put it into action in strong, real ways.

            h2 Frequently asked questions

            h3 How much does website localization cost?
            p To adequately answer this question, you must first determine who is translating and localizing your project. For instance, most agencies charge roughly $0.20 per word. On the other hand, hiring a freelancer for website translation can cost as little as $0.10 per word. But this is just translating words and no translation management at all.
            br
            p So this is where a <a href="https://locize.com/" title="localization service">localization service</a> comes in place; for the first 10,000 words, Locize charges roughly $0.004. So website localization involves more than just translating words; under <a href="/pricing.html" title="website localization pricing">pricing</a>, you can get a thorough description of how our expenses will be determined. As you can see, using a service like locize is extremely beneficial in terms of saving time and money.

            h3 How is website localization done?
            p The process of adapting an existing website to the target market's local language and culture is known as website localization. It is the process of adapting a website to a different linguistic and cultural surroundings, which technically involves much more than simple text translation. Simply use our <a href="https://docs.locize.com/integration/getting-started" title="getting started documentation">getting started documentation</a> to see how easy to can start with locize.
            br
            p To use our website-localization-service is as easy as this:
            br
            ul
              li Register for free
              li Set up a new project
              li Implement few lines of code
              li Add new or existing language segments
              li Translate your content
              li Proceed with localization
            br
            h3 How do I create a localization for my website?
            p
              | If you plan to localize your website, then i18n is for you. I18n or internationalization is often performed only once, at the start of the software design and development process. Rather to hardcoding each particular language every time you wish to translate a specific piece of text, internationalization prepares your codebase to accept alternative settings dependent on your target languages. It substitutes code with key placeholders that, when translated, automatically retrieve each foreign language without requiring fundamental technical modifications. If you don't know which i18n library or framework you should use, have a look at 
              a(href="/i18next.html") i18next
              | .

            h3 What kind of service locize is?
            p Locize is the software you should use to localize your website, app, game, whatever software, during the expansion or globalization of your company. Depending on your technology, locize can be easily implemented into your website (or software in general) with a few lines of code. You will then be able to manage the entire localization process within the software. With our real-time translation and <a href="https://locize.com/" title="localization software">localization-software</a>, your website-content become more engaging and professional.

          "text": "To adequately answer this question, you must first determine who is translating and localizing your project. For instance, most agencies charge roughly $0.20 per word. On the other hand, hiring a freelancer for website translation can cost as little as $0.10 per word. So this is where a localization service comes in place; for the first 10,000 words, Locize charges roughly $0.004. So website localization involves more than just translating words; under pricing, you can get a thorough description of how our expenses will be determined. As you can see, using a service like locize is extremely beneficial in terms of saving time and money."

          "text": "If you plan to localize your website, then i18n is for you. I18n or internationalization is often performed only once, at the start of the software design and development process. Rather to hardcoding each particular language every time you wish to translate a specific piece of text, internationalization prepares your codebase to accept alternative settings dependent on your target languages. It substitutes code with key placeholders that, when translated, automatically retrieve each foreign language without requiring fundamental technical modifications."
