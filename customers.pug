                p(style="font-size: 16px;") We’ve been using Locize for about 6 months for 2 different sites. Locize is a fantastic product for various reasons:
                ul(style="font-size: 15px;")
                  li Easy interface to administer translations. One can control exactly what each translator can see and they love using it. The interface also makes it easy to see what translations are missing as well as split up your application into different namespaces.
                  li Great integration into front end javascript. We are using VUE and there is an excellent 2 way flow where the site can pull the translations, but also use the API to send new keys.
                  li The pricing is different from other services, but much more fair. You pay more if you use more, rather than one giant fee.
                  li The support is prompt and very helpful.
                  li If the site is not business critical, the translate all via Google Translate is a great feature!

                p(style="font-size: 16px;") At Logiscool, we teach kids programming in more than ten countries. While the universal language of programming is English, managing our website translations for a growing number of languages quickly became a challenge.
                p(style="font-size: 16px;") Using i18next as our international framework enables us to use the same technology around our whole software stack, regardless the actual backend or framework we use. Locize is the icing on the cake – it made translation management unspeakably easier.
                p(style="font-size: 16px;") We love the editor support for in-text HTML tags and there’s finally someone who’s prepared to handle plurals by the book. Locize also helps us staying in touch with our growing number of translators at a daily basis, while the Locize API enables us to safely integrate with our build systems. Thank you!

                p(style="font-size: 16px;") We use locize to translate our product KE-chain. KE-chain is a cloud-based software product used for digital registrations in the construction and infra industry and now available in multiple languages.
                p(style="font-size: 16px;") We integrated locize within a day using the React i18n packages available. It was a frictionless experience integrating it and a frictionless experience adding the translations. It is ideal for a team that want to stay agile without imposing a forced translation flow.
                p(style="font-size: 16px;") The cost structure suited our use better than alternative solutions. We like using the translation hints by services such as Google, to help us to get 'something' quick which may be altered later by a native speaker.

                p It's a really outstanding service due to the following points.
                ul(style="font-size: 18px;")
                  li The fact that management of several languages can be corrected quickly through the operation of cross border commerce sites
                  li The fact that in addition to words, the URL and images can be managed too
                  li The fact that even those who are not engineers can operate it easily
                p We use locize not only for word but also for URL and image’s URL. We have separated help pages for en, ja, zh, zh-TW. i18next automatically switched the link to appropriated lang help’s page. Also we have separated images which contain en, ja, zh, zh-TW characters.

                p We utilize locize for several projects in the publishing industry. The team of locize made it a no brainer to shift over from a premature self-hosted localization tool to their SaaS.
                p In the rare case that features were missing, they have been implemented in no time. The support and feedback is great and the tool is easy to use.
                p We have many on premise installations without access to the internet (thus not using locizes cdn feature), it should be mentioned that integrating locize into our build and release workflow (gulp, gitlab ci) has been a breeze. I’d definitely recommend using it.
