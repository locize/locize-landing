                  | Locize took all the technical efforts related to localizing our frontend off from our shoulders with just a few lines of configuration.

                  | Replaced our old complex toolchain with just few API calls providing a user-friendly solution for translators at once.

                  | Using locize and its tools (i18next) saves us a LOT of time by not thinking about the texts and focusing on development only. It's then easy and fast to input all the translations on locize admin UI.
                p Thanks locize Team!

                p We utilize locize for several projects in the publishing industry. The team of locize made it a no brainer to shift over from a premature self-hosted localization tool to their SaaS.
                p In the rare case that features were missing, they have been implemented in no time. The support and feedback is great and the tool is easy to use. 
                p We have many on premise installations without access to the internet (thus not using locizes cdn feature), it should be mentioned that integrating locize into our build and release workflow (gulp, gitlab ci) has been a breeze. I’d definitely recommend using it.

                p It's a really outstanding service due to the following points.
                ul(style="font-size: 18px;")
                  li The fact that management of several languages can be corrected quickly through the operation of cross border commerce sites
                  li The fact that in addition to words, the URL and images can be managed too
                  li The fact that even those who are not engineers can operate it easily
                p We use locize not only for word but also for URL and image’s URL. We have separated help pages for en, ja, zh, zh-TW. i18next automatically switched the link to appropriated lang help’s page. Also we have separated images which contain en, ja, zh, zh-TW characters.

                  | I have been using Locize and it made it easier to connect with translators and get the job done. I would recommend to anyone looking for the same.
