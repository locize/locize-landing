These terms contain many legal disclosures that you should read carefully.</p>
<p>These terms are a legally binding contract between you and locize. By using the service, you agree to be bound by these terms and that you are not barred under any applicable law from entering into this agreement. If you are using the service on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these terms for that organization and you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to these terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that organization.</p>
<p>locize reserves the right to update and change the terms of service from time to time. We will inform you by email and inside the application upon such changes. <em>Continued use of the service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes.</em> You can review the most current version of the terms of service at any time at: <a href="https://locize.com/terms.html">https://locize.com/terms.html</a></p>

<p>1.3. We may change the service over time as we refine and add more features or may need to stop, suspend, or modify the services, content or features. Features may be removed as we see those were not used any longer by our customers or we offer better replacement options for them.

<h3>2. Availability of the locize service</h3>
<p>2.1. You understand and acknowledge that there may be interruptions in service both within and outside of our control.

<p>2.2. You understand and acknowledge that due to circumstances both within and outside of our control, access to the service may be interrupted, suspended or terminated. We retain the right at our sole discretion to deny service, or access to the service to anyone or an account, at any time and for any reason in accordance with Section 8 below. If reasonable and possible we will inform you upfront and search for solutions not having to take that steps.</p>
<p>2.3. We will not be liable for any loss or damage that you may incur as a result of some sort of unavailability in connection with the service.</p>

<p>10.4. We do not warrant that product descriptions or any translated information from your website is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free.
