    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="title.jpg"></p><p>Welcome to the world of CAT Tools, or Computer-Assisted Translation Software!</p><h3 id="Table-of-contents"><a href="#Table-of-contents" class="headerlink" title="Table of contents"></a>Table of contents</h3><ul><li><a href="#what">What are CAT tools?</a></li><li><a href="#features">What computer assisted translation tools can do?</a></li><li><a href="#benefits">Benefits of using CAT tools for translation</a></li><li><a href="#locize">Locize CAT</a></li><li><a href="#tms">TMS and CAT tools, what is different?</a></li><li><a href="#choosing">Choosing the right CAT tool: a buyer&#39;s guide</a></li><li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-are-CAT-tools"><a href="#What-are-CAT-tools" class="headerlink" title="What are CAT tools? "></a>What are CAT tools? <a name="what"></a></h2><p>These handy little programs are like having a personal translator in your pocket (or on your computer, whichever you prefer).</p><p>But what exactly is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_translation">CAT</a>, you ask? Well, it&#39;s pretty much exactly what it sounds like. It&#39;s software that helps you translate text from one language to another. Think of it like having a bilingual friend who you can text whenever you come across a word or phrase you don&#39;t understand.</p><p>Now, I know what you might be thinking: &quot;But wait, don&#39;t we already have <a href="../google-translate-accuracy/">Google Translate</a>?&quot; And yes, you&#39;re right! Google Translate is a great tool for quick and easy translations. But CATs are a bit different. Unlike typical web translators, CAT tools are significantly more robust and tailored specifically to meet the needs of professional translators and businesses, ensuring enhanced efficiency, accuracy, and overall quality in translations.</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l6NCrY2Ad9o" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><h2 id="What-computer-assisted-translation-tools-can-do"><a href="#What-computer-assisted-translation-tools-can-do" class="headerlink" title="What computer assisted translation tools can do? "></a>What computer assisted translation tools can do? <a name="features"></a></h2><p>Computer-assisted translation tools offer a range of capabilities to streamline and enhance the translation process:</p><h3 id="Glossary-Management"><a href="#Glossary-Management" class="headerlink" title="Glossary Management"></a>Glossary Management</h3><p>One of the most important features of CATs is their ability to &quot;remember&quot; translations. So, if you&#39;re working on a big project and you keep coming across the <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/glossary">same phrase</a> over and over again, the CAT will remember how you translated it the first time and will automatically use the same translation for all future instances. This can save you a lot of time and make your translations much more consistent.</p><h3 id="Translation-Memory"><a href="#Translation-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Translation Memory"></a>Translation Memory</h3><p>Another great feature of CATs is their ability to work with &quot;<a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/translation-memory">translation memories</a>&quot;. These are databases of previously translated text, which can be used to help speed up the translation process and ensure consistency. So, if you&#39;re translating a document and you come across a sentence that&#39;s already been translated before, the CAT will pull up the previous translation and suggest it to you. Pretty cool, right?</p><h3 id="Machine-Translation"><a href="#Machine-Translation" class="headerlink" title="Machine Translation"></a>Machine Translation</h3><p>Among the most crucial capabilities of CATs is their adeptness at memorizing translations. Picture this: amidst a large-scale project, encountering recurring phrases is inevitable. Here&#39;s where CAT tools shine. They diligently store these translations, committing them to memory. So, the next time you stumble upon that same phrase, fear not! Your trusty CAT tool will recall precisely how you translated it the first time. Seamlessly, it will apply the same translation across all subsequent instances, sparing you valuable time and ensuring impeccable consistency throughout your translations.</p><h3 id="Collaboration"><a href="#Collaboration" class="headerlink" title="Collaboration"></a>Collaboration</h3><p>In the realm of CATs, the ability to collaborate seamlessly stands out as a cornerstone feature. Imagine this scenario: you&#39;re part of a dynamic translation team, dispersed across different locations, yet working towards a common goal. CAT tools serve as the virtual hub where translators, editors, and stakeholders converge in real-time. Through robust collaboration tools, communication flows effortlessly, files are shared effortlessly, and version control is maintained meticulously. Whether you&#39;re providing feedback, making revisions, or simply brainstorming ideas, these tools ensure that every member of the team remains synchronized and empowered to contribute their expertise. As a result, collaboration becomes not just a process but a catalyst for achieving unparalleled translation outcomes.</p><h2 id="Locize-CAT"><a href="#Locize-CAT" class="headerlink" title="Locize CAT "></a>Locize CAT <a name="locize"></a></h2><p>Within Locize there is an ready-to-go CAT tool comprising three distinct views.<br /></p><h3 id="Global-View"><a href="#Global-View" class="headerlink" title="Global View"></a>Global View</h3><p>The global view provides an overview of all segments.

Therefore there is also an <a href="https://docs.locize.com/different-views/incontext">in-context view</a>.<br /><br /><img src="incontext.webp"></p><h2 id="Benefits-of-using-CAT-tools-for-translation"><a href="#Benefits-of-using-CAT-tools-for-translation" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of using CAT tools for translation "></a>Benefits of using CAT tools for translation <a name="benefits"></a></h2><p>So, to sum it up, CATs are like having your own personal translator who never forgets anything and can access a vast library of translations. If you&#39;re a professional translator, they&#39;re an absolute must-have tool. And if you&#39;re not, they can still be a handy tool to have around for those times when you need to translate something quickly and easily.</p><p>However, what precisely are these amazing technologies capable of, and how might they help you?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="market-expansion-strategy.webp" alt="market expansion strategy"></p><p>Expansion can bring many benefits. Ultimately, it aims to penetrate a new market or address a new target group. </p><p>By expanding your business activities, you lay the foundation for sustainable growth and increasing sales of your products or services. </p><p>However, before you start your project, you need good preparation. And this is where the Market Expansion Strategy comes into play. Without it, it will be difficult to expand successfully.</p><p>But what does a market expansion strategy look like, what advantages does it bring and what options do you have? </p><p>Let&#39;s get started.</p><h2 id="Table-of-contents"><a href="#Table-of-contents" class="headerlink" title="Table of contents"></a>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#what">What is a market expansion strategy?</a></li><li><a href="#why">Why consider market expansion?</a></li><li><a href="#advantages">What are the advantages of a market expansion strategy?</a></li><li><a href="#strategies">What market expansion strategies are there?</a></li><li><a href="#howto">How to go about developing a market expansion strategy?</a></li><li><a href="#failure">What if the market expansion strategy fails?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-is-a-market-expansion-strategy"><a href="#What-is-a-market-expansion-strategy" class="headerlink" title="What is a market expansion strategy? "></a>What is a market expansion strategy? <a name="what"></a></h2><p>A market expansion strategy is a strategic plan to expand your business into a new market. You are tapping into a customer segment that you have not previously addressed with your products or services. Overall, market expansion strategies are actually your maps that show you the way, be it geographically and/or in relation to a target group, to growth, increased sales and market placement.</p><h2 id="Why-consider-market-expansion"><a href="#Why-consider-market-expansion" class="headerlink" title="Why consider market expansion? "></a>Why consider market expansion? <a name="why"></a></h2><p>There are various reasons why a company decides to expand its market. One of the most frequently mentioned is increasing sales. Especially if your own market is saturated, it is worth thinking outside the box and expanding into a target market where demand and, as a result, sales potential are still high.</p><p>With a market expansion strategy in hand, diversification always goes hand in hand. This gives you the significant advantage of spreading the risk that you have when you only depend on one market. Even in the face of fluctuations in the economy, political events or the unforeseeable, your company remains much more robust.</p><p>Also take advantage of the economy of scale. By spreading your expenses over a larger output, you can multiply your efficiency but reduce your costs in the long term.</p><p>Being present in multiple markets inevitably leads to greater visibility and therefore greater brand awareness. This means that not only sales but also the market value increase. At the same time, you can keep up with your competitors or even set yourself apart from them.</p><p>From an even different perspective, market expansion gives you access to new talent that can prevent a shortage of skilled workers. You may also discover new, advanced technologies and business practices in a new market that you were not aware of before, but that could significantly increase your productivity and competitiveness.</p><h2 id="What-are-the-advantages-of-a-market-expansion-strategy"><a href="#What-are-the-advantages-of-a-market-expansion-strategy" class="headerlink" title="What are the advantages of a market expansion strategy? "></a>What are the advantages of a market expansion strategy? <a name="advantages"></a></h2><p>A well-planned market expansion strategy is, to put it bluntly, half the battle when it comes to your expansion. Above all, it helps you achieve your long-term goals and ensure that your growth is continuous but controlled.</p><p>Advantages of a Market Expansion Strategy are:</p><h3 id="1-Risk-reduction"><a href="#1-Risk-reduction" class="headerlink" title="1. Risk reduction"></a>1. Risk reduction</h3><p>By carrying out market research and analysis and starting pilot projects in a market expansion strategy, you can avoid possible risks of market expansionProactively identify, take appropriate countermeasures and thus minimize them. With a strategic approach, you avoid having to pay expensive fees and at the same time increase the likelihood of a successful market entry.</p><h3 id="2-Resource-allocation"><a href="#2-Resource-allocation" class="headerlink" title="2. Resource allocation"></a>2. Resource allocation</h3><p>Your resources, be it capital, staff or time, are limited. So that you can really use this effectively for your expansion, a market expansion strategy is essential. For example, you can identify the most attractive markets in advance, use the economies of scale and create synergies between different markets and your business areas.</p><h3 id="3-Competitive-advantage"><a href="#3-Competitive-advantage" class="headerlink" title="3. Competitive advantage"></a>3. Competitive advantage</h3><p>If your market expansion strategy is successful and you open up new markets, you will build sustainable competitive advantages. In other words, a market expansion strategy enables you to meaningfully differentiate your products and services from your competitors, to establish them strongly in the market and to build a loyal customer base.</p><h3 id="4-Innovation-and-learning"><a href="#4-Innovation-and-learning" class="headerlink" title="4. Innovation and learning"></a>4. Innovation and learning</h3><p>In addition to the advantages of risk minimization or resource distribution, a market expansion strategy always promotes internal company development, which you should not despise. Ultimately, a market expansion strategy requires new ideas, progressive business models and engagement with other cultures, target groups and competitors.</p><p>Market expansion can also mean that you have to optimize your products or services for the new market or even be inspired to create completely new ones. Furthermore, the experience and knowledge that you will gain from the expansion will be available to you in the long term, which you can then transfer to other areas of your company.</p><h3 id="5-Brand-perception-and-the-global-image"><a href="#5-Brand-perception-and-the-global-image" class="headerlink" title="5. Brand perception and the global image"></a>5. Brand perception and the global image</h3><p>An equally notable advantage of a market expansion strategy is that you can use market expansion to build up your image and the perception of your brand in a controlled manner. Be it with an international market expansion strategy or global market expansion strategies. Once the foundation has been laid, you can strengthen the trust of customers, investors and business partners and manage the entire process yourself, which contributes significantly to ensuring a reasonable reputation.</p><h2 id="What-market-expansion-strategies-are-there"><a href="#What-market-expansion-strategies-are-there" class="headerlink" title="What market expansion strategies are there? "></a>What market expansion strategies are there? <a name="strategies"></a></h2><p>A distinction is made between four market expansion strategies that you can use depending on your goals:</p><ul><li>Market penetration</li><li>Product development</li><li>Market development</li><li>Diversification</li></ul><p>Fortunately, these are not just purely theoretical approaches, but rather market expansion strategies that you can immediately implement in practice. We&#39;ll tell you what this might look like in the next sections.</p><h3 id="Market-penetration-existing-product-existing-market"><a href="#Market-penetration-existing-product-existing-market" class="headerlink" title="Market penetration (existing product, existing market)"></a>Market penetration (existing product, existing market)</h3><p>With market penetration as your market expansion strategy, you focus on strengthening your existing products or services in your current market and increasing their sales. Ergo, you try to sell more of what you offer - be it to existing customers or new customers. The approach is often the first step that companies implement as part of their market expansion strategy. Importantly, market penetration only works effectively if the market is not yet saturated. However, your risk remains low because you neither venture into unknown territory nor have to spend a lot of money. What helps you with this market expansion strategy with the goals of increasing market share, competitiveness and profit maximization are pricing strategies, advertising campaigns, sales promotions or improving services such as customer service. However, the growth potential remains manageable with this approach.</p><p>A classic example of market penetration is a company lowering its prices to attract more customers. A wireless carrier offers discounts or improved tariff plans to attract or persuade customers to switch from a competitor.</p><h3 id="Product-development-new-product-existing-market"><a href="#Product-development-new-product-existing-market" class="headerlink" title="Product development (new product, existing market)"></a>Product development (new product, existing market)</h3><p>When developing products as part of your market expansion strategy, you optimize your existing products and services for your market, modify variants or introduce a completely new offering. The aim is to better penetrate your existing markets or open up new market segments. This can be achieved by focusing on increasing customer value for your product range. With this market expansion strategy, always make sure that you take customer wishes into account in all innovations and improvements in order to stand out from your competitors in the long term.</p><p>Since you have to spend a little more money on product development, the risk also increases compared to market penetration. To avoid bad investments, you can pursue the virtual prototyping approach. You test your innovation BEFORE the actual development within a virtual environment under completely real conditions and marketing levels. This includes setting up a web presence.</p><p>An example of product development is introducing a new smartphone model with improved features and performance to encourage existing fans to upgrade and attract new, tech-savvy customers. An outstanding role model for such a market expansion strategy is undoubtedly Apple.</p><h3 id="Market-development-existing-product-new-market"><a href="#Market-development-existing-product-new-market" class="headerlink" title="Market development (existing product, new market)"></a>Market development (existing product, new market)</h3><p>Do you have an excellent product and want to conquer a new sales market? Then market development is your market expansion strategy. In market development, you strive to take your existing products or services into new markets. This can mean both geographical expansion (domestic or international) as well as addressing new target groups or opening up additional sales channels. The main goal is to discover new sales potential and expand your customer base. One advantage of this market expansion strategy is that you don&#39;t have to spend any money on further developing your products. However, market developments require that you have a thorough knowledge of the new field, its players, opponents and spectators. Furthermore, it is essential to carry out very finely graded target group marketing, which takes the respective cultural characteristics into account.</p><p>An example would be a food company that wants to sell its products internationally to reach new geographical markets.</p><h3 id="Diversification-new-product-new-market"><a href="#Diversification-new-product-new-market" class="headerlink" title="Diversification (new product, new market)"></a>Diversification (new product, new market)</h3><p>Probably the most comprehensive, risky, but also, if successful, strongest market expansion strategy is diversification. This means you are introducing a new product to a new market. There are two main types of diversification: related and unrelated diversification. With related diversification, you expand your offerings into areas that are logically related to your current environments. With unrelated diversification, you enter completely new business areas that have no direct connection to your previous activities. Note that these market expansion strategies involve an investment of money and time. However, if the equation of the two unknowns works out, the effort will undoubtedly have been worth it due to the enormous increase in sales.</p><p>An example of diversification would be a clothing manufacturer starting to produce and sell sports equipment - if this is related diversification - or entering the technology industry - if it is an unrelated diversification.</p><p>If you can&#39;t decide between the four market expansion strategies or would like to benefit from the advantages of several strategies, there are intermediate solutions:</p><ul><li>Market expansion: strategy of selling established products within new geographical markets while maintaining target group consistency.</li><li>Product Modification: Approach to bridging the gap between market penetration and product development by making slight adjustments to existing products to reintroduce them into the current market.</li><li>Limited diversification: adapting existing products to enter new geographical markets.</li><li>Partial diversification: strategy that involves either distributing new products into geographically new markets or introducing modified products to new target groups.</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-go-about-developing-a-market-expansion-strategy"><a href="#How-to-go-about-developing-a-market-expansion-strategy" class="headerlink" title="How to go about developing a market expansion strategy? "></a>How to go about developing a market expansion strategy? <a name="howto"></a></h2><p>Now you know what a market expansion strategy is, its advantages and its four common models. Now let&#39;s get to one of the most interesting parts: How do you develop such a strategy in practice?</p><p><img src="../market-expansion/SMART-goals-definition.png" alt="set the goals"></p><h3 id="1-Set-the-goals"><a href="#1-Set-the-goals" class="headerlink" title="1. Set the goals"></a>1. Set the goals</h3><p>Before starting your market expansion, you should set clear, measurable and realistic goals. All goals should address different aspects of your expansion, including sales, market share, customer acquisition, and brand awareness. Use the SMART principle when setting goals.</p><p>What are <a href="https://www.bitesizelearning.co.uk/resources/smart-goals-meaning-examples" title="SMART goals">SMART goals</a>?</p><p><b>Specific</b>: Define exactly what you want to achieve in each new market. For example, you could aim to achieve a certain level of sales or capture a certain percentage of market share within the first year of entering the market.</p><p><b>Measurable</b>: Make sure you can quantify your goals. This allows you to track progress over the long term and measure your successes. Examples of measurable goals could be: selling 10,000 units of your product in the first year or acquiring 500 new customers in the first six months.</p><p><b>Attainable</b>: Your goals should be challenging but realistic. To do this, consider your resources, competition and market conditions.</p><p><b>Relevant</b>: All of your goals should be closely tied to your company&#39;s overall business goals and overall strategy.

Failure is a natural part of entrepreneurship and holds valuable lessons that will help improve your future market expansion strategy.</p><p>First, you should conduct a thorough analysis to identify the reasons for the failure of your market expansion strategy. Illuminate all aspects of your market expansion strategy, from market research and target group analysis to marketing and sales. Take a close look at which assumptions were wrong, which approaches didn&#39;t work, and whether external factors such as economic changes or unforeseen events played a role.</p><p>Use this opportunity to learn from your mistakes and optimize your market expansion strategy. This might mean better understanding your audiences, adapting your products or services, or rethinking your marketing and sales efforts. Based on your analysis and the insights gained, you can then adjust your market expansion strategy accordingly. This means both minor optimizations and a comprehensive revision of your market expansion strategy plans. Be open to change and willing to try completely new things.</p><p>After you&#39;ve refocused your market expansion strategy, develop a new plan for entering the market or refocusing your operations. To do this, set yourself realistic goals and milestones and make sure that you have sufficient resources for implementation.</p><p>It should be said again: failure is not a reason to give up. Many successful companies initially failed before they found their way to success. Maintain your resolve and stay committed to pursuing your business goals.</p><p>What&#39;s important is that you learn from every failure and use this unique knowledge to improve your future endeavors. By remaining resilient and willing to adapt and learn, you can increase your chances of future success.</p>]]></content>

Until one of the translation suggestions is accepted, the actual value won't change.</p></div><h3 id="Managing-terminology"><a href="#Managing-terminology" class="headerlink" title="Managing terminology"></a>Managing terminology</h3><p>Terminology is the fundamental cornerstone of all translations. To describe objects and form sentences, people use words, phrases, and jargon. </p><p>If your content generation has to be extended, certain criteria for managing material must be established for all parties involved. </p><p>You should keep track of terms that should or shouldn&#39;t be translated via a glossary. It exists to facilitate the use of the language that your business likes by human translators.</p><h3 id="Use-the-translation-memory"><a href="#Use-the-translation-memory" class="headerlink" title="Use the translation memory"></a>Use the translation memory</h3><p>A TMS&#39;s translation memory feature is especially crucial since it greatly boosts the productivity of language localization <a href="/blog/language-localization/" title="language localization">language localization</a>. </p><p>You can utilize words and phrases from previous work rather than coming up with new language every time. To assist human translators, sentences that have already been translated are stored in a database called a translation memory (TM).</p><h3 id="Get-the-history-and-numbers"><a href="#Get-the-history-and-numbers" class="headerlink" title="Get the history and numbers"></a>Get the history and numbers</h3><p>Every project management tool must provide the most crucial indicators about budget, progress, and other factors.</p><p>The majority of the tasks are contained in one program by the TMS. As a result, reporting the numbers is a must. The data insights from the TMS help improve the administration of your localization projects.</p><p>Additionally, keeping track of all previous translations might be helpful. In the event of an inconvenience, it is possible to demonstrate at any moment who made what changes and when.</p><p>Locize, our translation management system, offers an overview of the control center with the key figures for the ongoing project:</p><p>The control center of our <a href="/" title="localization software">localization software</a> displays all pertinent high-level data:</p><ul><li>user management</li><li>billing (customer details, billing history, budget limit, ...)</li><li>project settings (slack integration, webhook, integration metrics, ...)</li><li>ordering (services, pending orders)</li><li>branches</li><li>project health and metrics</li></ul><h3 id="Auto-Machine-Translation"><a href="#Auto-Machine-Translation" class="headerlink" title="Auto Machine Translation"></a>Auto Machine Translation</h3><p>With this capability, the TMS attempts to entirely automate the translation process. Traditionally, an application program interface (API) is used to connect translated texts to an engine that handles the translation automatically. </p><p>Because the results from artificial intelligence are typically not 100% fine, a translator is frequently needed to evaluate the auto translation output.</p><p>For locize, the entire automatic machine translation process occurs in the backend, which means you&#39;ll see the translated result after saving the new keys in reference language.</p><h4 id="Should-you-choose-machine-translation-a-translation-agency-or-a-freelancer"><a href="#Should-you-choose-machine-translation-a-translation-agency-or-a-freelancer" class="headerlink" title="Should you choose machine translation, a translation agency or a freelancer?"></a>Should you choose machine translation, a translation agency or a freelancer?</h4><p>These are three options when there is a need of translating content. Whether to engage a translation agency, a freelancer, or make use of machine translation. </p><p>Machine translation would be the most cost-effective approach because it is virtually free. However, if no one reviews the translated information, there will undoubtedly be a lack of transaltion quality.</p><p>Freelance translators are frequently enthusiastic about their work. They are frequently subject specialists who can execute sophisticated translations in their fields. This might be a wonderful alternative for those on a restricted budget. Working with a person rather than a firm is less expensive, and you don&#39;t have to sacrifice quality.</p><p>Translation agencies have greater resources to devote to your job than a freelancer. In addition, they offer a wide range of translation and localization services. They have extensive expertise in assisting you to overcome linguistic and cultural difficulties.</p><p>You will discover your ideal match for sure.</p><h3 id="Integration-API"><a href="#Integration-API" class="headerlink" title="Integration API"></a>Integration API</h3><p>API technology is used by excellent TMS to connect to and interact with cloud-based services. This enables it to automate and expand translation management in any content management system for all content kinds.</p><p>There is thorough documentation for locize on how to utilize an API to integrate any of your applications. The documentation may be found at <a href="https://docs.locize.com/integration/api">docs.locize.com/integration/api</a>.</p><h2 id="Benefits-of-using-a-TMS"><a href="#Benefits-of-using-a-TMS" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of using a TMS "></a>Benefits of using a TMS <a name="benefits"></a></h2><p>Manual transmission and receipt of translated texts is inefficient for bigger projects and may result in unstructured chaos and significant financial loss.

They automate project procedures after putting in place a TMS, which significantly shortens project turnaround times. Weeks-long tasks can now be finished in a matter of days. This increased productivity enables the business to reallocate important resources, which is especially important in a situation when there is a shortage of trained labor. For instance, Company A reports a 25% gain in revenue in addition to completing 30% more tasks per month after implementing a TMS.</p><h3 id="20-lower-expenses-to-reinvest-in-growing-the-company"><a href="#20-lower-expenses-to-reinvest-in-growing-the-company" class="headerlink" title="20% lower expenses to reinvest in growing the company"></a>20% lower expenses to reinvest in growing the company</h3><p>Without a TMS, project management can be labor-intensive and costly. By simplifying project administration and automating key tasks, a TMS minimizes administrative overhead. For example, Company B cut its project management costs by 20% after implementing a TMS, directly contributing to profit growth. These cost savings can be reinvested in business expansion, technology upgrades, or boosting the bottom line.</p><h3 id="25-increase-in-revenue-as-demand-rises"><a href="#25-increase-in-revenue-as-demand-rises" class="headerlink" title="25% increase in revenue as demand rises"></a>25% increase in revenue as demand rises</h3><p>Company C was looking to expand its client base and take on more translation projects. However, they were concerned about managing increased workloads effectively. By adopting a TMS with robust scalability, they could effortlessly accommodate the growing demand. The TMS allowed them to streamline workflows and maintain efficiency as their client base expanded. The result?

    <title>Is SDL Trados Still Relevant in Today’s Localization Landscape?</title>
    <link href="https://locize.com/blog/is-sdl-trados-still-relevant/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="title.jpg"></p><p>In the field of translation and localization, there is one tool that has been dominant for decades: SDL Trados. This software has been a staple for translators and language service providers (LSPs) alike, offering a suite of features that streamline translation workflows and improve overall productivity. However, as the translation industry evolves and new technologies emerge, some are questioning whether SDL Trados is still relevant in today&#39;s localization landscape. In this article, we&#39;ll explore this question and take a closer look at SDL Trados, its advantages and disadvantages, and why some are turning to more modern translation management systems.</p><h2 id="What-is-SDL-Trados"><a href="#What-is-SDL-Trados" class="headerlink" title="What is SDL Trados?"></a>What is SDL Trados?</h2><p>SDL Trados is a translation memory software developed by SDL, a company that specializes in language technology and services. The software is widely used by translators and LSPs to manage translation workflows and improve translation quality. SDL Trados offers a range of features, including translation memory, terminology management, and automated workflows, all designed to improve efficiency and productivity in the translation process.</p><h2 id="Advantages-of-SDL-Trados"><a href="#Advantages-of-SDL-Trados" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of SDL Trados"></a>Advantages of SDL Trados</h2><h3 id="Translation-memory"><a href="#Translation-memory" class="headerlink" title="Translation memory"></a>Translation memory</h3><p>One of the key advantages of SDL Trados is its translation memory (TM) functionality. Translation memory is a database that stores previously translated content, allowing translators to reuse translations for repeated phrases and sentences. This can greatly reduce translation time and costs while improving consistency across translations.</p><h3 id="Terminology-management"><a href="#Terminology-management" class="headerlink" title="Terminology management"></a>Terminology management</h3><p>Another advantage of SDL Trados is its terminology management feature. This allows users to create and manage glossaries of key terms specific to their industry or project, ensuring consistency and accuracy across translations.</p><h3 id="Automated-workflows"><a href="#Automated-workflows" class="headerlink" title="Automated workflows"></a>Automated workflows</h3><p>SDL Trados also offers automated workflows, which can save significant time and effort in the translation process. For example, the software can automatically detect file formats, segment content, and suggest translations based on the translation memory and terminology database. This can speed up the translation process and reduce the risk of errors.</p><h2 id="Disadvantages-of-SDL-Trados"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-SDL-Trados" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of SDL Trados"></a>Disadvantages of SDL Trados</h2><h3 id="Expensive-licensing-fees"><a href="#Expensive-licensing-fees" class="headerlink" title="Expensive licensing fees"></a>Expensive licensing fees</h3><p>One of the main disadvantages of SDL Trados is its licensing fees. The software can be very expensive, especially for freelancers or small businesses. The licensing structure can also be complex, making it difficult for users to choose the right package for their needs.</p><h3 id="Complex-interface"><a href="#Complex-interface" class="headerlink" title="Complex interface"></a>Complex interface</h3><p>SDL Trados can also be complex to use, especially for new users. The interface can be overwhelming, and it may take some time to learn how to use all of the features effectively.</p><h3 id="Not-cloud-based"><a href="#Not-cloud-based" class="headerlink" title="Not cloud-based"></a>Not cloud-based</h3><p>Finally, SDL Trados is not cloud-based, meaning that users must install the software on their local machines. This can limit collaboration and accessibility, especially for teams working remotely.</p><h2 id="Alternatives-to-SDL-Trados"><a href="#Alternatives-to-SDL-Trados" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to SDL Trados"></a>Alternatives to SDL Trados</h2><p>As the translation industry evolves, new technologies are emerging that offer alternatives to SDL Trados. One of the most popular alternatives is cloud-based translation management systems, which offer greater collaboration and accessibility. One such system is <a href="/">locize</a>, which offers a range of features similar to SDL Trados but is entirely cloud-based.</p><h3 id="Cloud-based-solutions"><a href="#Cloud-based-solutions" class="headerlink" title="Cloud-based solutions"></a>Cloud-based solutions</h3><p>Cloud-based translation management systems, such as <a href="/">locize</a>, offer several advantages over traditional software like SDL Trados. For one, they can be accessed from anywhere, making them ideal for remote teams or teams working across different locations. They also offer greater collaboration features, such as real-time translation memory updates and more streamlined communication among team members. Another special advantage of <a href="/">locize</a> is the way it can be directly integrated to your software or website, this way translators can modify translations <a href="https://youtu.be/YQryHo1iHb8">without the need</a> to ask the developers to adapt their code or to redeploy their software or website. In addition, cloud-based systems often have lower upfront costs and are more scalable, allowing companies to pay only for what they need as they grow.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>While SDL Trados has been a dominant force in the translation industry for many years, it may no longer be the best fit for all companies. As the industry evolves, it is important to consider newer, cloud-based alternatives like <a href="/">locize</a> that offer greater collaboration, accessibility, and scalability. Ultimately, the best translation management system will depend on the specific needs of your company, so it is important to carefully evaluate the options before making a decision.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="localization.webp" alt="what is localization"></p><p>If you are asking yourself, <strong>what is localization</strong>, then this blog is here to help you. We take a closer look at what this means and how it can help you. </p><div style="border-left: 0.5px solid orange;padding: 0.5rem 2rem"><h2 style="color:orange;">What is localization</h2><p style="color:grey;">Localization involves adapting a product or service to align with the language, culture, or preferences of a specific audience. A successful localization effort results in a product or service that seamlessly integrates with the local culture, giving the impression that it was originally created for that specific market.</p></div><p>For international brands and organizations, it is essential in helping to give their customers the very best experience possible. An effective localization-process can transform a business, helping to increase reach and maximize engagements, but what exactly is it?</p><p>Let&#39;s get started.</p><h2 id="Table-of-contents"><a href="#Table-of-contents" class="headerlink" title="Table of contents"></a>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#concept">What is the concept of localization</a></li><li><a href="#examples">Real-life examples of successful localization-efforts</a></li><li><a href="#examples">Information on localization-strategies</a></li><li><a href="#goal">What are the goals of localization</a></li><li><a href="#resources">Resources related to the importance of localization in international markets</a></li><li><a href="#guides">Guides on how to implement localization</a></li><li><a href="#thoughts">Final thoughts</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-does-localization-mean"><a href="#What-does-localization-mean" class="headerlink" title="What does localization mean "></a>What does localization mean <a name="concept"></a></h2><p>So while language translation is the process of converting written content from one language into another, localization goes beyond this. It will look at things such as:</p><h3 id="Language"><a href="#Language" class="headerlink" title="Language"></a>Language</h3><p>Translating text and ensuring it&#39;s culturally appropriate, considering idiomatic expressions, slang, and terminology specific to the target language.</p><h3 id="Content-Adaptation"><a href="#Content-Adaptation" class="headerlink" title="Content Adaptation"></a>Content Adaptation</h3><p>Adapting content to align with the cultural norms, beliefs, and values of the target audience. This includes imagery, symbols, colors, and references that might be sensitive or offensive in a particular culture.</p><h3 id="Regional-Preferences"><a href="#Regional-Preferences" class="headerlink" title="Regional Preferences"></a>Regional Preferences</h3><p>Customizing the product or content to cater to regional preferences, such as date formats, currencies, units of measurement, and other regional differences.</p><h3 id="User-Interface-UI"><a href="#User-Interface-UI" class="headerlink" title="User Interface (UI)"></a>User Interface (UI)</h3><p>Adjusting the user interface, layout, and design to accommodate different languages and reading directions (e.g., right-to-left for Arabic or Hebrew).</p><h3 id="Legal-and-Regulatory-Compliance"><a href="#Legal-and-Regulatory-Compliance" class="headerlink" title="Legal and Regulatory Compliance"></a>Legal and Regulatory Compliance</h3><p>Ensuring that the product or content complies with local laws, regulations, and industry standards.</p><h3 id="Functionality"><a href="#Functionality" class="headerlink" title="Functionality"></a>Functionality</h3><p>Modifying features or functionality that may not be relevant or practical in the target market or adding features that are specific to that market.</p><h3 id="Testing"><a href="#Testing" class="headerlink" title="Testing"></a>Testing</h3><p>Rigorously testing the localized product or content to identify and resolve issues related to linguistic, cultural, or technical aspects.</p><p>Localization is a crucial strategy for businesses of all sizes because it makes their content more appealing to the audience they are trying to reach. The process of first enabling a product to be localized, then localizing it for various national audiences is sometimes know as <a href="/blog/globalization-vs-localization/" title="globalization">globalization</a>.</p><p>According to <a href="https://insights.csa-research.com/reportaction/305013126/Marketing">this article</a> 40% of consumers have said that they will never purchase from a website that wasn’t in their native language. While 75% have said that they would be more likely to use a business again if their aftersales care was in their native language.</p><p>With the help of this article, you can learn how to adapt your service or product to a specific language, culture, or target market, regardless of the industry you work in. </p><p>Additionally, we will explain how to adapt content or products for various markets and geographical areas.</p><p>But first, let&#39;s look at some successful examples of well-known brands using it.</p><p><img src="populations-look-and-feel.webp" alt="populations look and feel"></p><h2 id="Real-life-examples-of-successful-localization-efforts"><a href="#Real-life-examples-of-successful-localization-efforts" class="headerlink" title="Real-life examples of successful localization-efforts "></a>Real-life examples of successful localization-efforts <a name="examples"></a></h2><div style="display: flex; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 20px;"><div style="flex: 1; margin-right: 20px;">    <img src="airbnb.png" alt="Airbnb Image">    <h3>Business Example</h3>    <p>Internationalization is becoming increasingly more common, and businesses are now interacting with clients and customers from across the globe. Localization should now be an essential part of their growth strategy, covering everything from company websites and marketing materials to legal documents and product manuals.</p>    <p>One great example of this is Airbnb, which has successfully been able to expand its business into over 220 countries, each one offering a personal and localized touch to the consumer.</p>    <span style="font-size:0.7rem">Source: <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" title="airbnb">airbnb</a></span></div><div style="flex: 1;">    <img src="netflix.png" alt="Netflix Image">    <h3>Software Example</h3>    <p>Localization is also a vital strategy in the world of software development. Everything from user experience to overall design will need to be considered to ensure that customers are getting the very best experience.</p>    <p>A good example of software-localization is Netflix. The global streaming giant has become synonymous with efforts on both the translation side of things and on the developer side. The technology and processes that they utilize are translated and localized in every region, meaning the interface and apps change, as do the subtitles and voice dubbing of content. Even the films and TV shows they develop are localized for specific countries.</p>    <span style="font-size:0.7rem">Source: <a href="https://www.netflix.com/" title="netflix">netflix</a></span>  </div></div><div style="border-left: 0.5px solid orange;padding: 0.5rem 2rem"><p style="color:grey;">Check out our more real-life examples <a href="/customers.html" title="Customer Success Stories">on this page</a>.</p></div><h2 id="What-are-the-goals-of-localization"><a href="#What-are-the-goals-of-localization" class="headerlink" title="What are the goals of localization "></a>What are the goals of localization <a name="goal"></a></h2><p>The ultimate goal is to develop a clear user experience that helps to drive your marketing and support you in achieving your goals. However, there are many benefits that can come from implementing it, including:</p><h4 id="Enter-new-markets"><a href="#Enter-new-markets" class="headerlink" title="Enter new markets"></a>Enter new markets</h4><p>One of the main goals of a <a href="/blog/localization-strategy" title="localization-strategy">localization-strategy</a> is to help brands to easily enter new markets. It will help overcome any logistical or legal hurdles, ensuring smooth communication across every partner. </p><h4 id="Secure-a-competitive-edge"><a href="#Secure-a-competitive-edge" class="headerlink" title="Secure a competitive edge"></a>Secure a competitive edge</h4><p>Implementing localization can also help companies to develop a competitive edge. Going against competitors in a local market can be incredibly challenging as they often have the trust of local audiences. It will help you to build that trust, giving you the edge. </p><h4 id="Improve-customer-satisfaction"><a href="#Improve-customer-satisfaction" class="headerlink" title="Improve customer satisfaction"></a>Improve customer satisfaction</h4><p>Another important goal is that it helps to improve customer satisfaction. When they are seeing content in their own language and in a style they are more comfortable with; they are more likely to buy or use your products and services. </p><h4 id="Increase-brand-loyalty"><a href="#Increase-brand-loyalty" class="headerlink" title="Increase brand loyalty"></a>Increase brand loyalty</h4><p>When you are able to improve customer satisfaction, you will also increase brand loyalty. Communicating with customers in their own language and style will help you to secure their trust, increasing the likelihood of them returning. </p><h4 id="Maximize-your-profit"><a href="#Maximize-your-profit" class="headerlink" title="Maximize your profit"></a>Maximize your profit</h4><p>Above all, though, the main goal of a strategy is to help companies maximize their profit.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="software-localization.webp" alt="software localization" title="Software Localization"></p><p>According to a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/software-localization-market-reach-15-140100165.html" title="recent study">recent study</a>, the global market for software localization generated $5.9 billion in revenue in 2022 and is predicted to grow even more until 2032, when it is predicted to reach $15.6 billion.</p><p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic, as businesses shifted operations online and broadened their global reach as a result of increased business focus on global expansion, this topic has become even more important.</p><p>Software localization can be an expensive process, especially for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) with tight budgets, and it takes time and resources to ensure high-quality results in localization projects. </p><p>What is it about and what benefits can it offer your business?</p><p>If you are faced with this issue, you can get started with these details. </p><p>Let&#39;s go!</p><h2 id="Table-of-contents"><a href="#Table-of-contents" class="headerlink" title="Table of contents"></a>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#what">What is software localization?</a></li><li><a href="#undertaken">How does localization take place?</a></li><li><a href="#important">Why localization of software is important</a></li><li><a href="#process">Successful implementation</a></li><li><a href="#who">Who needs localization of software?</a></li><li><a href="#nextlevel">Test our solution for free</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-is-software-localization"><a href="#What-is-software-localization" class="headerlink" title="What is software localization? "></a>What is software localization? <a name="what"></a></h2><p>Software localization helps to adapt software to the language and circumstances of the target market while retaining its originality. This means that not only is the text being adapted into the relevant language, but the design and overall user experience (UX) are amended to ensure that it meets the needs of the target audience.</p><p>While <a href="../what-is-i18n/">internationalization (i18n)</a> is about developing a product to meet the demands of a specific culture or audience, localization of software is a far more in-depth solution. The process usually requires the complete modification of text and multimedia for a software product. </p><p>For example, trying to localize a piece of software that is in English into Chinese is not simply a case of translating the wording. The length of text and symbols are entirely different, meaning the whole visual layout will need to be amended to ensure the overall user experience (UX) remains the same.</p><p>Software localization goes much further than that, too. It also looks at the resources and links being used, the time- and date-format, the use of images or gestures to ensure they are culturally appropriate, and even the direction the text needs to be read in.</p><p>This makes the whole process incredibly complex and time-consuming process, but it is a worthwhile investment for any developer.</p><h2 id="How-does-localization-take-place"><a href="#How-does-localization-take-place" class="headerlink" title="How does localization take place? "></a>How does localization take place? <a name="undertaken"></a></h2><p>Software can be localised in two core areas, internationsalisation and then localization. The <b>internationalization</b> process <b>covers the design and development</b>, which means you should:</p><ul><li>review your application framework to ensure it can support your requirements</li><li>thoroughly plan your content, including understanding how much space translated text will require. </li><li>incorporate the needs regarding content into the design, helping to make the localization more effective.</li><li>code your strings to allow you to expand when required.</li><li>externalize any strings that have been prepped for localization</li></ul><p>Once you have successfully completed the internationalization phase, you should then begin to incorporate the <b>localization</b> phase. This is <b>the process of translating your content utilizing a skilled translator</b> and ensuring they are covering every part of your software.</p><p>The translation is one of the most important parts of your localization, so once complete, you must thoroughly review everything. This includes checking the accuracy of the content, the quality of the language, and the terminology being used.</p><p>Once finished, you will then need to copy the translations into your software and begin testing it in every locality you are targeting. When you are certain that the software is working as designed and free from bugs, it can then be released to the public.</p><h3 id="Waterfall-vs-continuous-localization-What’s-the-difference"><a href="#Waterfall-vs-continuous-localization-What’s-the-difference" class="headerlink" title="Waterfall vs continuous localization: What’s the difference?"></a>Waterfall vs continuous localization: What’s the difference?</h3><p>For localization of software there are different workflows. The most traditional is to break down the activities into linear sequential phases - the so called waterfall workflow, where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to a specialization of tasks.</p><p><img src="waterfall-workflow.webp" alt="waterfall workflow" title="waterfall workflow"></p><p><a href="/blog/modern-continuous-localization/">Continuous software localization</a> combines software development and localization into one process so that software developers work in parallel with the localization team from the very beginning:</p><p><img src="continous-workflow.webp" alt="continous workflow" title="continous workflow"></p><h2 id="Why-localization-of-software-is-important"><a href="#Why-localization-of-software-is-important" class="headerlink" title="Why localization of software is important? "></a>Why localization of software is important? <a name="important"></a></h2><p>Thanks to the advancement of technology, we now live in a highly connected world. We are able to communicate with companies and organizations across the globe in a matter of seconds. However, while communication has never been more accessible, being able to understand the nuances and cultural differences of these communities is crucial.</p><p><b>Globalization</b> gives software developers the chance to access <b>hundreds of millions of potential new customers</b>. In order to do this successfully, though, they need to ensure they are offering every client the very best user experience.</p><p>There are many benefits to focusing on the software-localization-process, including:</p><h3 id="Maximizing-your-sales"><a href="#Maximizing-your-sales" class="headerlink" title="Maximizing your sales"></a>Maximizing your sales</h3><p>Localization gives you the chance to enjoy success on an international scale. When you are able to provide the end user with the very best experience, no matter where in the world they might be located, it will ensure you can quickly and easily enter new markets. Not only will this help to maximize your sales, but it can also help to strengthen your position in both the local and international market.</p><h3 id="Improving-user-experience"><a href="#Improving-user-experience" class="headerlink" title="Improving user experience"></a>Improving user experience</h3><p>High-quality localization can ensure everyone is able to enjoy the very best experience when using your products. Not only will they be able to clearly understand what you are saying, but they will get the most out of your software too. This improves the overall user experience, giving them a greater impression of your brand.</p><h3 id="Staying-ahead-of-your-competitors"><a href="#Staying-ahead-of-your-competitors" class="headerlink" title="Staying ahead of your competitors"></a>Staying ahead of your competitors</h3><p>In the fast-paced world that we live in, keeping your brand ahead of your competitors has never been more important. The software localization definition is about giving your customers the very best experience possible. That will allow you to stand out from the crowd, minimizing the risk of losing potential customers while also helping you to attract even more customers.</p><h3 id="Enhancing-feedback"><a href="#Enhancing-feedback" class="headerlink" title="Enhancing feedback"></a>Enhancing feedback</h3><p>Another significant benefit of the localization process, but one that is often overlooked, is that it can help you enjoy more feedback. When you have more users engaging with your software, it will help you to develop more in-depth feedback and generate more ideas for the future.</p><p><img src="project-managers.webp" alt="project managers" title="project managers"></p><h2 id="9-steps-to-successfully-implement-software-localization"><a href="#9-steps-to-successfully-implement-software-localization" class="headerlink" title="9 steps to successfully implement software localization "></a>9 steps to successfully implement software localization <a name="process"></a></h2><p>This guide will walk you through the essential steps to successfully implement software localization in your company. Whether you&#39;re a small startup or a large enterprise, embracing localization can help your software resonate with international users and drive business growth.</p><h3 id="1-Assessment-and-Planning"><a href="#1-Assessment-and-Planning" class="headerlink" title="1) Assessment and Planning"></a>1) Assessment and Planning</h3><p>Choose the languages and markets you want to target.Check to see if your software is localization-ready with these questions:</p><ul><li>Is your code dependable and bug-free?</li><li>Has your main language UI been put into place?</li><li>Is your text in main language complete?</li><li>Is your character encoding correct?</li></ul><h3 id="2-Translation"><a href="#2-Translation" class="headerlink" title="2) Translation"></a>2) Translation</h3><p>Choose professional translators or translation tools. Maintain context and accuracy during the translation process. A professional <a href="/blog/tms/">translation management system</a> has integrations with platforms offering translation services. A TMS supports increased project effectiveness, lower manual error rates, and guarantee timely delivery of localized software. </p><h3 id="3-Visual-Elements-Graphic-Design"><a href="#3-Visual-Elements-Graphic-Design" class="headerlink" title="3) Visual Elements / Graphic Design"></a>3) Visual Elements / Graphic Design</h3><p>Customize visual elements to align with local preferences. Respect cultural norms and sensitivities. It would help if you also considered implementing a style guide, covering things such as your branding, tone of voice, and formality. This will ensure a consistent and clear approach, no matter where in the world your users are accessing your software.</p><h3 id="4-Compliance-with-Legal-and-Regulatory-Requirements"><a href="#4-Compliance-with-Legal-and-Regulatory-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="4) Compliance with Legal and Regulatory Requirements"></a>4) Compliance with Legal and Regulatory Requirements</h3><p>Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations. Conduct a thorough analysis of legal and regulatory requirements that pertain to your software, including data privacy laws like <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" title="GDPR">GDPR</a>, accessibility standards such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines" title="WCAG">WCAG</a> , and industry-specific regulations.</p><h3 id="5-Testing"><a href="#5-Testing" class="headerlink" title="5) Testing"></a>5) Testing</h3><p>Thoroughly test the localized software for functionality and display.

That means rather than seeing it as a task to complete in the final stages, you should incorporate it in every step of your software development. By adopting this approach, you can ensure that you are maximizing the user experience, and it can also help to speed up the delivery time.</p><h3 id="Use-a-localization-platform"><a href="#Use-a-localization-platform" class="headerlink" title="Use a localization platform"></a>Use a localization platform</h3><p>Effective software localization is a vast project, and utilizing a proven <a href="https://locize.com" title="localization management platform">localization management platform</a> can help to make the process easier. When choosing a platform, you should ensure that it has been developed specifically for localization. This will help to offer greater customization and allow you to integrate essential tools.

"></a>Who needs localization of software? <a name="who"></a></h2><p>The next decision is whether it is right for you. If your software targets a specific community or a selected region, localization might not be required.</p><p>However, if you are looking to expand into wider communities or give yourself the opportunity to do that at a later date, then it is something you should consider. Even if you are not considering an international move just yet, you should prepare as much as you can during the development stage.</p><p>The industry you work in should also be a major consideration. <b>Software localization should be a major consideration</b> for those working in the e-commerce, legal, or governmental sectors. Of course, it is not just limited to these sectors, so make sure you consider both your current and future requirements when deciding if you need l10n.</p><p>In this technology-driven world, globalization means seeing an increasing number of organizations and companies working beyond their traditional localities. Software localization is crucial in helping you to successfully expand your business to other countries, allowing you to maximize your sales, boost your profits, and stand out from the crowd.</p><p>You definitely will need it when</p><ul><li>your business plan targets multiple regions or is region specific</li><li>you&#39;re developing your software code right now.

In the coming years, we can expect to see a number of developments that will improve the accuracy and efficiency of language translation, making it easier for people and businesses to communicate across borders.</p><p>One of the most exciting developments in the field of translation is the use of neural machine translation (NMT), like <a href="../google-translate-accuracy/">Google Translate</a>. NMT is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that is able to learn the intricacies of a particular language and apply that knowledge to translations. This has led to a significant improvement in the quality of translations, particularly for less common languages.</p><p>Another area where we can expect to see advancements is in the use of natural language processing (NLP) to aid in localization. NLP is a field of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and human language. By using NLP techniques, like <a href="../google-translate-accuracy/#google-translate-competitors">ChatGPT</a>, software can be made to understand and respond to language in a more human-like way. This will make localization more accurate and efficient, as software will be able to understand the nuances and idioms of different languages and cultures.</p><p>With the increasing use of virtual and augmented reality technology, we can expect to see more demand for the translation of multimedia content. The ability to translate and localize video, audio and other multimedia content will become increasingly important as this technology becomes more prevalent. This also present new challenges and possibilities for localization, as translation engine will need to deal with idiomatic language, context, and tone.</p><p>We can also expect to see an increase in the use of crowdsourcing for translation and localization. By leveraging the power of the crowd, companies will be able to quickly and cost-effectively translate and localize their content into multiple languages. This has already <a href="https://docs.locize.com/guides-tips-and-tricks/working-with-translators#use-the-crowdbased-service-branched-projects">been used in some companies</a>, but will become more mainstream in the future as the approach improves and becomes more accessible.</p><p>In conclusion, the field of translation and localization is constantly evolving, and we can expect to see a number of exciting advancements in the coming years. The use of neural machine translation, natural language processing, and multimedia localization will improve the accuracy and efficiency of language translation. Additionally, the use of crowdsourcing will make it more cost-effective for businesses to communicate across borders. These developments will have far-reaching implications for industries such as e-commerce, education, entertainment, and many more, breaking down language barriers and making the world a more connected place.</p><script type="application/ld+json">  {    "@context": "https://schema.org",    "@type": "FAQPage",    "mainEntity": [{      "@type": "Question",      "name": "What is neural machine translation (NMT), and how is it changing the translation industry?",      "acceptedAnswer": {        "@type": "Answer",        "text": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses deep learning techniques to understand and translate text from one language to another.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="title.jpg" alt="TypeScript Localization made easy with this step-by-step guide using i18next ✅" title="TypeScript Localization example"></p><p>As our world becomes increasingly interconnected, the development of web applications that cater to a <a href="../grow-online-business/">global audience</a> takes precedence among developers. If you&#39;re a TypeScript developer, you&#39;re likely acquainted with the advantages of static typing and the assurance it provides in your codebase. When it comes to internationalization (<a href="../what-is-i18n/">i18n</a>) and localization (<a href="../what-is-software-localization/">l10n</a>), maintaining the same level of type safety becomes crucial. This is precisely where <a href="https://www.i18next.com/">i18next</a>, an influential i18n framework, enters the picture.</p><p>In the past, i18next already furnished TypeScript definitions for its API, enabling developers to benefit from type checking while utilizing the library. However, a significant limitation persisted, specifically the absence of type safety for translation keys. Consequently, if a translation resource was missing or underwent a name change, the TypeScript compiler failed to detect it, resulting in potential errors during runtime.</p><p><img src="ts_api.jpg"></p><p>Nevertheless, with the advent of the new iterations of i18next, that limitation has been overcome <em>(thanks largely to <a href="https://github.com/pedrodurek">Pedro Durek</a>)</em>. Now, i18n keys boast complete type safety. Whenever a developer employs a non-existent or modified i18n key, the TypeScript compiler immediately raises an error, promptly alerting you to the issue before it gives rise to runtime complications. In addition, there is also an improved intellisense experience.</p><p>Within this guide, we will delve into the art of leveraging the latest version of i18next to attain translations that are impervious to type-related errors in your TypeScript applications. We will encompass everything from the fundamentals of i18next setup to advanced techniques. All the while, you will benefit from the added safety net of type checking for your translation keys.</p><p>By the conclusion of this guide, you will possess a profound comprehension of how to harness the force of i18next&#39;s type-safe translations within your TypeScript projects. You will be equipped to ensure that your translations are not only precise and adaptable but also consistently error-free, courtesy of the seamless integration between i18next and TypeScript. Let us embark on this journey together and furnish you with the knowledge and tools necessary to create localized applications that effortlessly cater to diverse language preferences while maintaining the robustness of your codebase.</p><h2 id="In-Memory-translations"><a href="#In-Memory-translations" class="headerlink" title="In-Memory translations "></a>In-Memory translations <a

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="title.jpg"></p><p>In today&#39;s globalized world, creating multilingual applications is crucial to reaching a wider audience. One of the key components of successful application localization is accurate translation. However, it&#39;s not uncommon to encounter missing translations when using <a href="https://www.i18next.com/">i18next</a>, a popular internationalization framework. These missing translations can lead to a confusing user experience and undermine the efforts put into localization. In this article, we will explore various strategies and techniques to gracefully handle missing translations in <a href="https://www.i18next.com/">i18next</a>, enabling you to provide a polished and seamless multilingual application.</p><h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Before diving into the details, let&#39;s first understand the significance of i18next and the challenges posed by missing translations. i18next is a powerful JavaScript library that simplifies the process of internationalizing web applications. It allows developers to easily manage translations for different languages by usually organizing them in language files and using unique translation keys. This approach ensures that the application&#39;s content can be dynamically translated based on the user&#39;s preferred language.</p><p>However, when translations are missing for specific keys or languages, it can disrupt the localization workflow. Users may encounter untranslated content, placeholders, or even errors, leading to a poor user experience. To avoid such situations, it is essential to have effective strategies in place to handle missing translations and maintain a high level of quality in your multilingual application.</p><h2 id="Understanding-i18next-Translation"><a href="#Understanding-i18next-Translation" class="headerlink" title="Understanding i18next Translation"></a>Understanding i18next Translation</h2><p>To effectively address missing translations, it&#39;s important to have a clear understanding of how i18next translation works. In i18next, translations are usually stored in language files, typically in JSON format. Each translation string is associated with a unique key that is used to retrieve the translated content. These language files are organized based on the supported languages, allowing the application to load the appropriate translations based on the user&#39;s language preference.</p><p>Maintaining translated content requires regular updates to language files whenever new features are added or existing ones are modified. This ensures that translations remain accurate and up to date, providing a seamless experience for users across different languages.</p><h2 id="Identifying-Missing-Translations"><a href="#Identifying-Missing-Translations" class="headerlink" title="Identifying Missing Translations"></a>Identifying Missing Translations</h2><p>Before addressing missing translations, it&#39;s crucial to identify them. There are several techniques you can employ to detect untranslated content in your application. One effective approach is to enable i18next&#39;s debug mode, which logs warnings for missing translations in the browser&#39;s console. By inspecting these warnings, you can quickly identify the translation keys that require attention.</p><p>Additionally, thorough testing and quality assurance play a vital role in identifying missing translations. Test your application with different languages and carefully review the content for any untranslated strings. By following these practices, you can ensure that your application&#39;s translations are comprehensive and accurate.</p><h2 id="Strategies-to-Handle-Missing-Translations"><a href="#Strategies-to-Handle-Missing-Translations" class="headerlink" title="Strategies to Handle Missing Translations"></a>Strategies to Handle Missing Translations</h2><p>When it comes to handling missing translations, there are several strategies you can employ in your i18next workflow:</p><p><strong>1. Using Fallback Languages</strong>: To provide a default content for missing translations, you can utilize <a href="https://www.i18next.com/principles/fallback#language-fallback">fallback languages</a>. When a translation is missing for a specific key, i18next can automatically fallback to a default language and display the corresponding translation. This ensures that users still receive meaningful content even if a specific translation is unavailable.</p><p><strong>2. Implementing Placeholder Text (default value)</strong>: Another approach is to implement <a href="https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/essentials#passing-a-default-value">placeholder text</a> for untranslated content. This allows you to display temporary text or placeholders instead of leaving the content blank. Placeholder text can provide context to the user and give them an idea of what the translated content would be.</p><p><strong>3. Customizing Error Handling</strong>: i18next provides <a href="https://www.i18next.com/overview/configuration-options#missing-keys">customization options</a> for handling missing translations. You can define custom error handlers to display informative messages or alternative content when a translation is missing. This way, you can tailor the error handling to match your application&#39;s requirements and maintain a consistent user experience.</p><p><strong>4. Systematically Track Missing Translations: Leveraging Community and Machine Translation Services</strong>: When facing a large volume of translations or time constraints, leveraging community translation platforms or machine translation services can be beneficial. Platforms like locize enable collaboration with translators, making it easier to manage and update translations. Additionally, with the <a href="https://www.i18next.com/overview/configuration-options#missing-keys"><code>saveMissing</code></a> feature in i18next, you can automatically save missing translations and leverage <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/auto-machine-translation">machine translation services</a> to provide initial translations that can later be refined by human translators. This is how such a workflow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFV_vhJs5DY&t=401s">may look like</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFV_vhJs5DY&t=401s"><img src="auto-translate-missing.gif"></a></p><p>By implementing these strategies, you can ensure that your application gracefully handles missing translations, providing a seamless experience for users across different languages.</p><h2 id="Best-Practices-for-i18next-Localization-Workflow"><a href="#Best-Practices-for-i18next-Localization-Workflow" class="headerlink" title="Best Practices for i18next Localization Workflow"></a>Best Practices for i18next Localization Workflow</h2><p>To maintain a smooth localization workflow with i18next, it&#39;s important to follow some best practices:</p><p><strong>1. Establishing a Clear Translation Process</strong>: Define a clear process for managing translations, including <a href="https://docs.locize.com/guides-tips-and-tricks/keeping-track-of-new-translations">how and when translations are updated</a>. This ensures that translations remain accurate and up to date.</p><p><strong>2. Collaborating with Translators and Maintaining a Glossary</strong>: Establish effective communication channels with translators and maintain a <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/glossary">glossary of frequently used terms</a>. This promotes consistency and accuracy across translations.</p><p><strong>3. Consistent Formatting and Placeholders</strong>: Ensure that translations follow consistent <a href="../i18n-formats-javascript/#i18next">formatting</a> guidelines and utilize placeholders effectively. This helps maintain the layout and structure of your application across different languages.</p><p><strong>4. Version Control and Tracking Changes</strong>: Use some sort of <a href="https://docs.locize.com/more/versioning">versioning</a> and <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/history">history</a> capabilies to track changes in language files. This allows you to easily revert to previous translations if needed and track modifications over time.</p><p>By incorporating these best practices into your i18next localization workflow, you can streamline the translation process and maintain a high level of quality in your multilingual application.</p><h2 id="Improving-User-Experience"><a href="#Improving-User-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Improving User Experience"></a>Improving User Experience</h2><p>Handling missing translations not only involves providing alternative content but also focuses on enhancing the user experience. Here are some tips to improve user experience in the context of translations:</p><p><strong>1. Communicating Missing Translations</strong>: When a translation is missing, it&#39;s important to communicate this to the user clearly. Displaying an informative message or a placeholder indicating that the content is being translated can help manage user expectations.</p><p><strong>2. Providing Clear Instructions for Translators</strong>: If you collaborate with translators, it&#39;s essential to provide clear instructions and guidelines for translations. This includes <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/context">context information</a>, style guides, and any specific considerations that might be relevant.</p><p><strong>3. Using Context and Variables</strong>: Take advantage of i18next&#39;s support for <a href="https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/context">context</a> and <a href="https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/interpolation">variables</a> in translations. By providing additional context or dynamically substituting variables, you can ensure that translations remain accurate and contextually relevant.</p><p><strong>4. Avoiding Truncated or Overlapping Text</strong>: Consider the length of translated strings and ensure they fit within the layout of your application. Truncated or overlapping text can lead to readability issues and a subpar user experience.</p><p>By considering these aspects, you can provide a seamless and intuitive experience for users, even in multilingual applications with missing translations.</p><h2 id="Enhancing-i18next-Performance"><a href="#Enhancing-i18next-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Enhancing i18next Performance"></a>Enhancing i18next Performance</h2><p>As your application grows and incorporates more languages, optimizing the performance of i18next becomes important. Here are some strategies to enhance the performance of your i18next implementation:</p><p><strong>1. Caching Translations</strong>: Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the number of requests made to load translations. <a href="https://docs.locize.com/more/caching">Caching</a> translations <a href="https://docs.locize.com/more/caching/alternative-caching">locally</a> or utilizing a <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/cdn-content-delivery-network">CDN</a> can significantly improve the performance of your application.</p><p><strong>2. Minifying and Bundling Language Files</strong>: Minify and <a href="https://docs.locize.com/more/general-questions/do-i-have-to-use-the-locize-cdn-or-can-i-host-bundle-the-translations-directly">bundle</a> your language files to reduce their size. This helps reduce network latency and improves the loading speed of your application.</p><p><strong>3. Implementing Lazy Loading</strong>: <a href="https://www.i18next.com/how-to/add-or-load-translations#load-using-a-smart-backend-plugin-serving-directly-from-a-cdn">Load translations dynamically</a> when they are needed rather than upfront. This approach, known as lazy loading, reduces the initial loading time of your application and improves perceived performance.</p><p><strong>4. Considering Dynamic Content and Reactivity</strong>: If your application contains dynamic content that changes frequently, ensure that your i18next implementation can handle such reactivity. This allows translations to be updated dynamically without requiring a page reload.</p><p>By implementing these performance optimization techniques, you can ensure that your multilingual application provides a fast and responsive user experience across different languages.</p><h2 id="Future-Trends-in-i18next-Translation"><a href="#Future-Trends-in-i18next-Translation" class="headerlink" title="Future Trends in i18next Translation"></a>Future Trends in i18next Translation</h2><p>As technology advances, so does the field of translation and localization.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="title.jpg"></p><p>As businesses expand their reach to global audiences, localization becomes crucial to ensure their message reaches the target market accurately. However, translating content accurately can be challenging, especially when context is not considered. In this article, we will explore the importance of context in localization and how some context features can help improve translation accuracy.</p><h2 id="Understanding-Context-in-Localization"><a href="#Understanding-Context-in-Localization" class="headerlink" title="Understanding Context in Localization"></a>Understanding Context in Localization</h2><p>Context plays a crucial role in accurately translating content. It refers to the circumstances, conditions, or background surrounding a word or phrase that contributes to its meaning. Without proper context, translators may misunderstand the intended message, leading to an inaccurate translation. Some situations where context is particularly important include idiomatic expressions, cultural references, and technical terms.</p><h3 id="Examples"><a href="#Examples" class="headerlink" title="Examples"></a>Examples</h3><p><strong>- Inaccurate translations:</strong> Without context, translators may misinterpret the meaning of a phrase, resulting in a less accurate translation. For example, if a software application has a button with the label &quot;ship&quot; a translator without context might translate it to German as &quot;Schiff&quot; <em>(large boat for transporting people)</em> instead of &quot;versenden&quot; <em>(send / transport)</em> leading to confusion for the user.</p><p><strong>- Cultural insensitivity:</strong> Without context, translations may be culturally insensitive or even offensive. For example, a literal translation of a phrase or idiom in one language may not make sense or be considered offensive in another language.</p><p><strong>- Inconsistent terminology:</strong> Without context, translators may use inconsistent terminology, resulting in confusion for users. For example, if a software application uses different terms to refer to the same feature in different parts of the application, users may have difficulty understanding how to use it.</p><p><strong>- Technical errors:</strong> Without context, translators may not have the technical knowledge necessary to accurately translate technical terms or phrases. For example, a translator may not understand the technical meaning of a term like &quot;cache&quot; and translate it as &quot;hidden storage&quot; leading to confusion for the user.</p><h2 id="Best-Practices-for-Using-locize-39-s-Context-Features"><a href="#Best-Practices-for-Using-locize-39-s-Context-Features" class="headerlink" title="Best Practices for Using locize&#39;s Context Features "></a>Best Practices for Using locize&#39;s Context Features <a name="context-features"></a></h2><p>Locize offers several powerful features to help improve translation accuracy: specific <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/context#context-information-per-key-segment">context information per segment</a>, <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/context#incontext-view">InContext view</a>, <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/glossary">terminology glossary</a>, and <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/context#screenshots">screenshot</a> feature.</p><p><a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/context#context-information-per-key-segment">Specific context information</a> allows users to add notes, links, and descriptions to provide additional context for each individual key/segment.<img src="key_context.png"></p><p>The <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/context#incontext-view">InContext view</a> enables users to connect content from their website directly with their content on their localization project on locize.<img src="incontext_editor.png"></p><p>The <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/glossary">glossary</a> is a lexica that contains terminology to be used or not be used in the translations.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="marketing-localization-illustration.webp" alt="localization marketing"></p><p>Technology has accelerated globalization, allowing organizations to connect with customers across the world with ease. However, it can be tough to know where to start when it comes to implementing a localization marketing strategy. </p><p>An older example, but still valid as it shows the importance of marketing localization, was that of Nokia. The company faced a major setback when introducing its <a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/nokias-lumia-means-um-prostitute-in-spanish/">Lumia phone in Spanish-speaking regions</a> due to the product&#39;s name being colloquially associated with the term &quot;prostitute&quot; in Spanish. </p><p>Today you are going to learn exactly how to avoid marketing-localization mistakes and how to implement a localization procedure in your business.</p><h2 id="Table-of-contents"><a href="#Table-of-contents" class="headerlink" title="Table of contents"></a>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#marketinglocalization">What is localization in marketing?</a></li><li><a href="#importance">Why is localization in global marketing important?</a></li><li><a href="#yourbusiness">How to implement marketing localization in your business</a></li><li><a href="#mistakes">Potential mistakes to avoid in global marketing localization</a></li><li><a href="#globalexamples">Exploring successful global marketing campaigns: Examples from known brands</a></li><li><a href="#measure">How to measure global marketing efforts</a></li><li><a href="#7steps">7 steps for marketers and project managers to effectively localize their marketing content</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-is-localization-in-marketing"><a href="#What-is-localization-in-marketing" class="headerlink" title="What is localization in marketing? "></a>What is localization in marketing? <a name="marketinglocalization"></a></h2><p>Simply put, localization in marketing is the process of adapting your marketing material to ensure that it meets the interests and needs of your various target markets. </p><p>Working across a global market means you will be interacting with different cultures and customer expectations. Being able to understand their needs will allow you to effectively translate your material and maximize your chances of converting leads into long-term customers. </p><h2 id="Why-is-localization-in-global-marketing-important"><a href="#Why-is-localization-in-global-marketing-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is localization in global marketing important? "></a>Why is localization in global marketing important? <a name="importance"></a></h2><p>Did you know that 50% of <a href="https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/global-ecommerce-statistics" title="online shoppers">online shoppers</a> purchase something from a company that is outside their home country? While globalization is a wonderful way to increase your business, competition is also incredibly tough. </p><p><a href="../localization/" title="Localization">Localization</a> will help to give your brand the edge by ensuring you are reaching customers in their native language. Localization is much more than just translation, though. It is about using the cultural idioms, phrases, and symbolism, helping to increase trust and overall satisfaction.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Process</th><th>Purpose</th><th>What is adapted</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Marketing Translation</td><td>Create marketing messages that resonate in other markets</td><td>Message (copy, text)</td></tr><tr><td>Marketing Localization</td><td>Create experiences that resonate in other markets</td><td>Message, visuals, UX elements</td></tr><tr><td>Localization Marketing</td><td>Leverage localization for growth through a digital marketing strategy</td><td>Systems and processes (to support the strategy)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="How-to-implement-marketing-localization-in-your-business"><a href="#How-to-implement-marketing-localization-in-your-business" class="headerlink" title="How to implement marketing localization in your business "></a>How to implement marketing localization in your business <a name="yourbusiness"></a></h2><p>Now we have answered the question, “what is localization in marketing?” it is time to look at how you can begin to implement it into your business. This can seem a daunting process, but there are several steps to remember:</p><p><strong>1. Hire the experts</strong><br>Working with professionals is one of the most important steps, as they will have a clear idea of your demographics, the language of your target audience, their culture, and the nuances that will make you sound like a local.</p><p><strong>2. Localize your website</strong><br>Alongside your marketing materials, you should also localize your website. <a href="https://www.english.com/blog/english-language-internet/">Over 75%</a> of the world’s population does not speak English, so failing to optimize your website for non-English speakers will significantly restrict your reach and sales. </p><p><strong>3. Humanize your brand</strong><br>Another vital aspect of your localization marketing strategy should be humanizing your brand. When potential customers see your brand engaging in their language, using cultural elements, popular slang and words in their products and services, they are far more likely to complete their purchase.</p><p><strong>4. Use local partners</strong><br>Influencers now play a major role in marketing campaigns for businesses across almost every industry. However, when it comes to localizing your marketing plan, you should look at the partners you are operating with and adapt accordingly to influencers in the local market. </p><h2 id="Potential-mistakes-to-avoid-in-global-marketing-localization"><a href="#Potential-mistakes-to-avoid-in-global-marketing-localization" class="headerlink" title="Potential mistakes to avoid in global marketing localization "></a>Potential mistakes to avoid in global marketing localization <a name="mistakes"></a></h2><p>Despite its importance, there are many common mistakes that organizations make in their localization strategy, including:</p><p><strong>Focusing on a universal approach</strong>One of the most common mistakes is adopting a universal approach. Effective localization is not a one-size-fits-all and requires careful tailoring to ensure your brand is reaching the most effective touch points of your target market.</p><p><strong>Not localizing every aspect</strong>Another common mistake is only localizing certain aspects, such as print advertising. Neglecting certain areas, such as your socials or website, can lead to customers heading elsewhere. </p><p><strong>Poor translation</strong> Poor translation is another common mistake when it comes to marketing localization. Working with a professional localization partner will ensure that you are not using any embarrassing or incorrect phrasing. </p><p><a href="https://docs.locize.com/more/figma-plugin"><img src="prototyping-for-global-audience.webp" alt="Easily Create Prototypes for Multilingual Interfaces"></a></p><h2 id="Exploring-successful-global-marketing-campaigns-Examples-from-known-brands"><a href="#Exploring-successful-global-marketing-campaigns-Examples-from-known-brands" class="headerlink" title="Exploring successful global marketing campaigns: Examples from known brands "></a>Exploring successful global marketing campaigns: Examples from known brands <a name="globalexamples"></a></h2><p>Transcreation is a term used in the advertising and marketing industry to refer to the process of adapting a message from one language and culture to another while maintaining the intended emotion, tone, and context of the original message. </p><p>It goes beyond just translation as it involves the creative process of rewriting and adapting the message to fit the cultural and linguistic nuances of the target audience, while still conveying the same meaning and impact as the original message.</p><p>Transcreation is especially important for global marketing campaigns, where the same message needs to be conveyed across different languages and cultures. It allows companies to effectively communicate their brand message and values to a global audience, while also respecting the unique cultural differences and nuances of each region.</p><p>When done effectively, a global marketing campaign can transform a business and propel them onto success. Some great examples include:</p><p><strong>Red Bull</strong>One of the leading brands in the world, Red Bull can often feel like a local company. Their support of local sporting events, from F1 to Soapbox races, ensures they are continuously being placed in front of their relevant audience. </p><p><strong>Airbnb</strong> Since its launch in 2008, Airbnb has grown from its San Francisco base to become one of the most recognized businesses in the world. Its <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/made-possible-hosts-airbnb-linh-lai">“Made Possible By Hosts”</a> campaign brought the company into the homes of potential customers across the globe. </p><p><strong>McDonald’s</strong>The iconic golden arches of McDonald’s are recognized across the globe, and its marketing efforts are one of the best examples of localization. While the colors and themes remain similar, the fast food chain focuses on using region-specific menus; for instance, the use of flatbreads in the Middle East or Macaroons in France.  </p><h2 id="How-to-measure-global-marketing-efforts"><a href="#How-to-measure-global-marketing-efforts" class="headerlink" title="How to measure global marketing efforts "></a>How to measure global marketing efforts <a name="measure"></a></h2><p>While there can be no denying the benefits that come from marketing localization, it is vital that you are effectively measuring your results. </p><p>In order to determine your performance, you should first set yourself some clear goals of what you want to achieve and by when. This will act as your benchmark and will allow you to track whether you are on course to achieve them. </p><p>Of course, one of the biggest factors to consider is your ROI.</p><p>In this <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/07/a-refresher-on-marketing-roi" title="what is Marketing ROI-guide">&quot;what is Marketing ROI-guide&quot;</a> you will find more information about how to measure it.</p><p>This is a very effective method of understanding the efficiency of your global marketing efforts as there is a clear correlation between your activities and sales.
