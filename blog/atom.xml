    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="what-is-translation.webp" alt="What is translation"></p><p>In a globally networked world, cultural communication is becoming a strategic success factor for companies that operate worldwide. While there are countless methods of translation, the central goal always remains to convey content accurately and engagingly to the target audience. </p><p><strong>Translation should therefore be seen as an integral part of a comprehensive <a href="../localization-strategy/" title="localization strategy">localization strategy</a></strong> and not as an isolated process.But what exactly are translations, what types are there and what factors are important in localization translation?</p><h2 id="What-is-translation"><a href="#What-is-translation" class="headerlink" title="What is translation?"></a>What is translation?</h2><p>Translation is the process of transmitting text or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoken_language#:~:text=A%20spoken%20language%20is%20a,opposed%20to%20a%20written%20language." target="__blank" title="spoken language">spoken language</a> from one language to another while preserving the original meaning, tone and intent as accurately as possible. Translation requires not only a comprehensive understanding of the source and target languages, but also in-depth cultural knowledge to correctly capture nuances and idiomatic expressions. It therefore goes far beyond a literal translation and aims to render the content authentically and comprehensibly in the new language context.</p><h2 id="Why-are-translations-so-important-for-international-companies"><a href="#Why-are-translations-so-important-for-international-companies" class="headerlink" title="Why are translations so important for international companies"></a>Why are translations so important for international companies</h2><p>For global companies, localization translation is essential to overcome <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_barrier#:~:text=A%20language%20barrier%20is%20a,even%20dialects%20in%20some%20cases." target="__blank" title="language barriers">language barriers</a> and effectively address customers in their own language. Professional translations promote customer loyalty and market acceptance, while inaccurate translations can jeopardize a company&#39;s reputation and cause costly misunderstandings.</p><p>Through professional translations, companies have the opportunity to present their products, services and brand messages clearly and persuasively in different languages to build trust and loyalty among international customers. </p><blockquote>In addition, a good translation ensures that cultural nuances and regional characteristics are taken into account to avoid misunderstandings and increase credibility. </blockquote><p>In areas such as marketing, the drafting of legal documents or the development of technical manuals, an accurate and culturally appropriate translation must always be available to avoid errors and ensure the international success and image of the company.</p><h2 id="What-are-the-different-types-of-localization-translation"><a href="#What-are-the-different-types-of-localization-translation" class="headerlink" title="What are the different types of localization translation?"></a>What are the different types of localization translation?</h2><p>There are different types of translation, each tailored to specific needs and content.These include the following:</p><h3 id="Specialist-translation"><a href="#Specialist-translation" class="headerlink" title="Specialist translation"></a>Specialist translation</h3><p>Specialist translations are specialized in certain subject areas such as medicine, law, technology or business. They require a deep understanding of the specialist language and terminology to ensure accurate and error-free translations.</p><h3 id="Business-translation"><a href="#Business-translation" class="headerlink" title="Business translation"></a>Business translation</h3><p>The term business translation covers the transfer of content between two languages that supports international business activities. This includes various documents, marketing materials and digital resources.</p><h3 id="Document-translation"><a href="#Document-translation" class="headerlink" title="Document translation"></a>Document translation</h3><p>Document translation involves the creation of business translations, business correspondence, internal communications, manuals, contracts, technical specifications and other important documents. The challenges here often lie in the large volume and fragmented structure of the documents, as well as the need to maintain consistent terminology throughout the text.</p><h3 id="Literary-translation"><a href="#Literary-translation" class="headerlink" title="Literary translation"></a>Literary translation</h3><p>This is the translation of books, poems and other literary works. The aim is to preserve not only the meaning, but also the style, tone and cultural nuances of the original.</p><h3 id="Legal-translation"><a href="#Legal-translation" class="headerlink" title="Legal translation"></a>Legal translation</h3><p>Whether contracts, deeds, patents or other legal documents, legal translations place high demands on the translator. As these are binding, they must be accurate and comply with the legal standards of both countries. Translations of court and legal documentation are another sub-category of this specialty area. </p><p>Arrest warrants, registrations, certificates, declarations, affidavits, patents, trademarks, proceedings, lawsuits, decrees, contracts and insurance policies are just a few examples of legal documents that need to be translated.</p><h3 id="Marketing-and-advertisement-translation"><a href="#Marketing-and-advertisement-translation" class="headerlink" title="Marketing and advertisement translation"></a>Marketing and advertisement translation</h3><p><a href="../localization-marketing/" title=" marketing localization">Marketing</a> and advertising translation often requires a creative translation that adapts the message to the cultural and emotional expectations of the target audience. The translation should achieve the same feeling and effect as the original.</p><h3 id="Medical-translation"><a href="#Medical-translation" class="headerlink" title="Medical translation"></a>Medical translation</h3><p>Medical translation is subject to strict requirements and includes clinical trial protocols, patient information, regulatory documents and other critical texts. Due to the potentially vital consequences, this type of translation requires specialized expertise, the utmost precision and special attention to detail.</p><h3 id="E-commerce-translation"><a href="#E-commerce-translation" class="headerlink" title="E-commerce translation"></a>E-commerce translation</h3><p>In global e-commerce, multilingualism is important to appeal to customers in different markets. Landing pages, product descriptions, customer reviews and blog articles must be translated into the respective target market language. It is important to find a balance between precision and SEO optimization and to take cultural nuances into account.</p><h3 id="Technical-translation"><a href="#Technical-translation" class="headerlink" title="Technical translation"></a>Technical translation</h3><p>This includes translations of technical documents such as manuals, instructions and technical specifications. Accurate, clear and comprehensible terminology is particularly important here to ensure that products are used correctly.</p><h3 id="Localization-translation"><a href="#Localization-translation" class="headerlink" title="Localization translation"></a>Localization translation</h3><p>Localization involves the comprehensive adaptation of a product or service to the cultural and linguistic conditions of a target market. This form of translation is often used for software, websites or games and takes regional characteristics into account.</p><h2 id="What-factors-play-a-role-in-localization-translation"><a href="#What-factors-play-a-role-in-localization-translation" class="headerlink" title="What factors play a role in localization translation?"></a>What factors play a role in localization translation?</h2><p>Let&#39;s take a closer look at localization translation and take a closer look at this type of translation. Several important factors are required to ensure that the content is not only linguistically but also culturally adapted to the target market.</p><ul><li>Localization translation goes beyond mere translation and takes into account cultural characteristics such as regional holidays, country-specific symbols, colors and images, which can have different meanings depending on the culture.<br><br></li><li>The language is adapted to local dialects, language variants and idioms in order to sound authentic and understandable. This is particularly important in order to address the target group at eye level and create a personal connection.<br><br></li><li>Content must be adapted to the legal requirements of the target market, especially for legal documents, product descriptions and data protection guidelines, to ensure compliance.<br><br></li><li>Information such as currencies, units of measurement (e.g. inches instead of centimeters) and date formats (e.g. day, month, year) need to be converted to avoid misunderstandings and create a familiar user experience.<br><br></li><li>The tone and style of the translation should be adapted to the expectations of the target audience. For example, a more formal approach may be preferred in some countries, while other markets may expect more casual, informal language.<br><br></li><li>For software and websites, technical adaptations play a role, such as supporting different characters, text lengths and layout changes to ensure the application displays correctly on all devices and platforms in the target market.<br><br></li><li>For digital content, it is important to adapt <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword" target="__blank" title="keywords">keywords</a> to local search terms in order to remain visible in search engines. Localization therefore also includes optimization for the respective language and region.<br><br></li><li>Images, symbols and graphics should be adapted to cultural expectations. An image that evokes positive associations in one region could be interpreted differently or even be perceived as inappropriate in another region.</li></ul><h2 id="How-can-translations-be-implemented"><a href="#How-can-translations-be-implemented" class="headerlink" title="How can translations be implemented?"></a>How can translations be implemented?</h2><p>Localization translations can be implemented through a combination of strategies and technologies that together ensure that the content is translated into the target languages in an accurate and culturally appropriate way.The first step is to find and select professional translators or specialized translation agencies who have the necessary expertise and understanding of the target culture. The experts then produce an initial translation.To increase efficiency, modern translation tools such as <a href="../tms/" title="what is a translation management system">translation management systems</a> are usually used, which store previously translated segments and reuse them as required. </p><p>This maintains consistency and speeds up the translation process considerably. Other core tools include CAT tools (computer-aided translation), which help translators to translate content even more accurately through automation.Key functions of CAT tools include</p><ul><li>Translation memory: saves segments for consistent reuse to save working time.</li><li>Glossaries: Allow the management of terminological specifications to ensure consistent terms.</li><li>Quality assurance: Automated checks detect errors and promote accuracy.</li></ul><p><img src="localization-translation-process.webp" alt="localization translation process?"></p><p>A translation management system (TMS) extends these functions even further and usually includes additional project and workflow management. It therefore facilitates the coordination of complex projects and can be linked to CMS, CRM or e-commerce platforms. In this way, TMS platforms support companies in efficiently integrating their translations into existing business processes and ensuring the quality of international communication.</p><p>However, experienced localization experts or specialized tools are essential for localization, i.e. adapting to cultural peculiarities. They not only translate, but also adapt the content to the cultural and legal requirements of the target market.</p><blockquote>The growing importance of speech-to-text technology in the translation industry is highlighted by <a href="https://slator.com/microsoft-previews-ai-speech-translation-app/" title="Microsoft's announcement" target="__blank" >Microsoft's announcement</a> of a standalone app for speech-to-text.</blockquote><h3 id="Machine-translation-vs-human-translation-which-is-better"><a href="#Machine-translation-vs-human-translation-which-is-better" class="headerlink" title="Machine translation vs. human translation: which is better?"></a>Machine translation vs. human translation: which is better?</h3><p>Machine translation and human translation each have their strengths and are suitable for different requirements. The choice between the two depends heavily on factors such as quality, speed, cost and the required understanding of cultural nuances.</p><p>Machine translation is useful when large volumes of text need to be translated quickly and rough comprehensibility is sufficient. Modern machine translations, supported by artificial intelligence, offer high speed and are often more cost-effective than human translations. They are well suited to simple or standardized texts, such as simple manuals or internal documents, where the risk of misunderstandings is low. However, machines often reach their limits with creative, emotional or culturally sensitive texts. Nuances, wordplay or contextual subtleties are difficult or even impossible to translate correctly.</p><p>Human translation, on the other hand, is particularly superior for demanding, creative or culturally complex texts. Professional translators have a deep understanding of the subtleties and cultural context of a language, which is crucial for high-quality, authentic and emotionally appealing translations. This enables them to accurately convey not only the meaning, but also the intention and style of the original. For marketing materials, literary texts and legal documents, these differences are simply indispensable.</p><p>In many cases, however, a combination of the two is also useful: machine translations can be created as a first version and then checked and adapted by human translators. This approach, known as “post-editing”, utilizes the speed of the machine while ensuring quality through human sensitivity.Do you need a high-quality and fast translation of your documents in order to grow internationally?

In the end, it’s not always easy to find a Translation and Localization Company that meets your expectations.</p><p>This article will cover exactly that: How do you find professional Translation and Localization Companies, why is it so important, and what options are available?</p><h2 id="What-is-a-Translation-and-Localization-Company"><a href="#What-is-a-Translation-and-Localization-Company" class="headerlink" title="What is a Translation and Localization Company?"></a>What is a Translation and Localization Company?</h2><p>Translation and Localization Companies are service providers specializing in translating content from one language to another. However, their services go beyond traditional translation bureaus. These companies also ensure that content aligns with the cultural, legal, and regional specifics of the target market.</p><p>While translation focuses solely on the language aspect, <a href="https://locize.com/blog/localization/" title="localization">localization</a> ensures that texts and other content are relevant and understandable within the specific cultural context.</p><p>What does this look like in practice? A Translation and Localization Company doesn’t just adapt the language of a product manual, for example; it also considers local units of measurement, date and currency formats, legal requirements, and cultural preferences.</p><h2 id="Benefits-of-Working-with-a-Translation-and-Localization-Company"><a href="#Benefits-of-Working-with-a-Translation-and-Localization-Company" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of Working with a Translation and Localization Company"></a>Benefits of Working with a Translation and Localization Company</h2><p>Working with Translation and Localization Companies offers several advantages. The most important is the professional quality and accuracy a Translation and Localization Company provides. Qualified native speakers and experts work together to consider every small cultural nuance of the target market, reducing the risk of misunderstandings and increasing relevance.</p><p>For companies offering products in other countries, managing translations can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. A Translation and Localization Company reduces the workload and ensures timely project completion.</p><p>Thanks to automated <a href="https://locize.com/?lng=en" title="software localization tools">software localization tools</a> and resources, established Translation and Localization Companies can localize extensive content, such as entire websites or software applications, in a short time. This saves time, especially when rapid market entry in multiple countries is required.</p><p>Other advantages of working with Translation and Localization Companies include scalability, technological support, legal compliance, and cost savings. Ultimately, the goal is to deliver tailored content to the market to enhance the user experience and increase the likelihood of product purchases or service bookings. For any globally operating company, a Translation and Localization Company can provide considerable competitive advantages.</p><h2 id="Who-Needs-a-Translation-and-Localization-Company"><a href="#Who-Needs-a-Translation-and-Localization-Company" class="headerlink" title="Who Needs a Translation and Localization Company?"></a>Who Needs a Translation and Localization Company?</h2><p>Primarily, Translation and Localization Companies are aimed at companies and organizations looking to expand internationally or establish themselves in various markets. Industries such as e-commerce, software, technology, marketing, healthcare, law, and tourism particularly benefit from Translation and Localization Companies, as these areas require content to be adapted for diverse languages and cultures. Besides global players, small and medium-sized businesses entering new markets to maximize their international success potential can also benefit from these services.</p><h2 id="How-to-Find-a-Good-Translation-and-Localization-Company"><a href="#How-to-Find-a-Good-Translation-and-Localization-Company" class="headerlink" title="How to Find a Good Translation and Localization Company"></a>How to Find a Good Translation and Localization Company</h2><p>Finding a high-quality Translation and Localization Company is not as easy as it may seem. A strategic approach to the search is highly recommended.</p><p><strong>Important</strong>: Define your requirements for the Translation and Localization Company. Here are some questions that may help:</p><ul><li>Which languages and regions need to be covered?</li><li>What type of content (e.g., <a href="https://locize.com/blog/website-localization/" title="website localization">website localization</a> , software- or marketing materials-) should be translated and localized?</li><li>Do you need industry-specific expertise (e.g., medical, technical, or legal knowledge)?</li><li>Are technical tools such as Translation Memory, machine translation, or terminology databases required for your project?</li></ul><p>The clearer your needs, the easier it will be to find a suitable provider.</p><p>Moreover, a Translation and Localization Company should be able to showcase several successful projects. Experience in this specialized niche is essential. Ideally, the company holds awards or ISO certifications. Also, ensure that either qualified, experienced translators or, even better, professional native speakers work at the Translation and Localization Company. The use of modern tools such as Translation Memory (TM) or Machine Translation (MT) further enhances efficiency.</p><p><strong>Don&#39;t Forget</strong>:</p><ul><li>Good communication and reliable customer support with dedicated contacts</li><li>Transparent pricing without hidden costs</li><li>Flexibility to handle urgent requests when needed</li><li>Punctuality and reliability with adherence to all deadlines</li></ul><p>A company’s website, listed references, and customer reviews on independent platforms can provide a solid first impression of Translation and Localization Companies. Ideally, the Translation and Localization Company will offer a test project, allowing you to assess their skills and service in detail. Ultimately, the goal is to establish a long-term partnership with the Translation and Localization Company, so take your time in choosing wisely.</p><h2 id="Why-Finding-the-Right-Partner-Can-Be-Difficult"><a href="#Why-Finding-the-Right-Partner-Can-Be-Difficult" class="headerlink" title="Why Finding the Right Partner Can Be Difficult"></a>Why Finding the Right Partner Can Be Difficult</h2><p>As we have often mentioned, finding a professional Translation and Localization Company is not always straightforward. But why is that? Because there is no clear definition, and essentially anyone offering translation, interpretation, subtitling, dubbing, and localization can call themselves a Translation and Localization Company.</p><p>Additionally, there is a wide range of providers, from small specialized agencies to large global service providers. You’ll quickly notice that the quality of translations and localizations varies significantly. Often, the first attempt to find a suitable Translation and Localization Company fails because there seems to be no provider with the required industry-specific knowledge, or the pricing structure is vague. The latter is often a sign of unprofessional companies.</p><p>Yes, finding the right Translation and Localization Companies requires some effort.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="title.jpg"></p><p>Welcome to the world of CAT Tools, or Computer-Assisted Translation Software!</p><h3 id="Table-of-contents"><a href="#Table-of-contents" class="headerlink" title="Table of contents"></a>Table of contents</h3><ul><li><a href="#what">What are CAT tools?</a></li><li><a href="#features">What computer assisted translation tools can do?</a></li><li><a href="#benefits">Benefits of using CAT tools for translation</a></li><li><a href="#locize">Locize CAT</a></li><li><a href="#tms">TMS and CAT tools, what is different?</a></li><li><a href="#choosing">Choosing the right CAT tool: a buyer&#39;s guide</a></li><li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-are-CAT-tools"><a href="#What-are-CAT-tools" class="headerlink" title="What are CAT tools? "></a>What are CAT tools? <a name="what"></a></h2><p>These handy little programs are like having a personal translator in your pocket (or on your computer, whichever you prefer).</p><p>But what exactly is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_translation">CAT</a>, you ask? Well, it&#39;s pretty much exactly what it sounds like. It&#39;s software that helps you translate text from one language to another. Think of it like having a bilingual friend who you can text whenever you come across a word or phrase you don&#39;t understand.</p><p>Now, I know what you might be thinking: &quot;But wait, don&#39;t we already have <a href="../google-translate-accuracy/">Google Translate</a>?&quot; And yes, you&#39;re right! Google Translate is a great tool for quick and easy translations. But CATs are a bit different. Unlike typical web translators, CAT tools are significantly more robust and tailored specifically to meet the needs of professional translators and businesses, ensuring enhanced efficiency, accuracy, and overall quality in translations.</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l6NCrY2Ad9o" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><h2 id="What-computer-assisted-translation-tools-can-do"><a href="#What-computer-assisted-translation-tools-can-do" class="headerlink" title="What computer assisted translation tools can do? "></a>What computer assisted translation tools can do? <a name="features"></a></h2><p>Computer-assisted translation tools offer a range of capabilities to streamline and enhance the translation process:</p><h3 id="Glossary-Management"><a href="#Glossary-Management" class="headerlink" title="Glossary Management"></a>Glossary Management</h3><p>One of the most important features of CATs is their ability to &quot;remember&quot; translations. So, if you&#39;re working on a big project and you keep coming across the <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/glossary">same phrase</a> over and over again, the CAT will remember how you translated it the first time and will automatically use the same translation for all future instances. This can save you a lot of time and make your translations much more consistent.</p><h3 id="Translation-Memory"><a href="#Translation-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Translation Memory"></a>Translation Memory</h3><p>Another great feature of CATs is their ability to work with &quot;<a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/translation-memory">translation memories</a>&quot;. These are databases of previously translated text, which can be used to help speed up the translation process and ensure consistency. So, if you&#39;re translating a document and you come across a sentence that&#39;s already been translated before, the CAT will pull up the previous translation and suggest it to you. Pretty cool, right?</p><h3 id="Machine-Translation"><a href="#Machine-Translation" class="headerlink" title="Machine Translation"></a>Machine Translation</h3><p>Among the most crucial capabilities of CATs is their adeptness at memorizing translations. Picture this: amidst a large-scale project, encountering recurring phrases is inevitable. Here&#39;s where CAT tools shine. They diligently store these translations, committing them to memory. So, the next time you stumble upon that same phrase, fear not! Your trusty CAT tool will recall precisely how you translated it the first time. Seamlessly, it will apply the same translation across all subsequent instances, sparing you valuable time and ensuring impeccable consistency throughout your translations.</p><h3 id="Collaboration"><a href="#Collaboration" class="headerlink" title="Collaboration"></a>Collaboration</h3><p>In the realm of CATs, the ability to collaborate seamlessly stands out as a cornerstone feature. Imagine this scenario: you&#39;re part of a dynamic translation team, dispersed across different locations, yet working towards a common goal. CAT tools serve as the virtual hub where translators, editors, and stakeholders converge in real-time. Through robust collaboration tools, communication flows effortlessly, files are shared effortlessly, and version control is maintained meticulously. Whether you&#39;re providing feedback, making revisions, or simply brainstorming ideas, these tools ensure that every member of the team remains synchronized and empowered to contribute their expertise. As a result, collaboration becomes not just a process but a catalyst for achieving unparalleled translation outcomes.</p><h2 id="Locize-CAT"><a href="#Locize-CAT" class="headerlink" title="Locize CAT "></a>Locize CAT <a name="locize"></a></h2><p>Within Locize there is an ready-to-go CAT tool comprising three distinct views.<br /></p><h3 id="Global-View"><a href="#Global-View" class="headerlink" title="Global View"></a>Global View</h3><p>The global view provides an overview of all segments.

Read more in the <a href="https://docs.locize.com/different-views/focus">focus view docs</a>.<br /><br /><img src="focus.webp"><br /></p><h3 id="In-Context-View"><a href="#In-Context-View" class="headerlink" title="In-Context View"></a>In-Context View</h3><p>Your website, where the content is displayed, is always the best context. Therefore there is also an <a href="https://docs.locize.com/different-views/incontext">in-context view</a>.<br /><br /><img src="incontext.webp"></p><h2 id="Benefits-of-using-CAT-tools-for-translation"><a href="#Benefits-of-using-CAT-tools-for-translation" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of using CAT tools for translation "></a>Benefits of using CAT tools for translation <a name="benefits"></a></h2><p>So, to sum it up, CATs are like having your own personal translator who never forgets anything and can access a vast library of translations. If you&#39;re a professional translator, they&#39;re an absolute must-have tool. And if you&#39;re not, they can still be a handy tool to have around for those times when you need to translate something quickly and easily.</p><p>However, what precisely are these amazing technologies capable of, and how might they help you? Let us examine the various benefits and features of computer-assisted translation as we go deeper into this field.</p><h3 id="Efficiency"><a href="#Efficiency" class="headerlink" title="Efficiency"></a>Efficiency</h3><p>There is an unmatched efficiency in the field of CAT tools. Imagine being able to move quickly through projects by reusing previously translated segments thanks to the power of translation memory. This simplified procedure not only expedites your work but also frees up valuable time to concentrate on polishing your translations to excellence.</p><h3 id="Accuracy"><a href="#Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="Accuracy"></a>Accuracy</h3><p>CAT tools are known for their precision. Think about this: you have a vast array of automated recommendations at your disposal as you utilize the machine translation integration. However, the final translation is guided by your perceptive eye, making sure that every word conveys the intended meaning. Accuracy is not only an objective when you have CAT tools on your side; it is a standard that is steadfastly maintained.</p><h3 id="Time-Savings"><a href="#Time-Savings" class="headerlink" title="Time Savings"></a>Time Savings</h3><p>CAT tools are a match for time, that elusive resource. Imagine this: you can translate words with never-before-seen speed as you take use of glossary management and translation memory. What used to take hours now only takes minutes, allowing you to spend more time refining your craft without worrying about running out of time.</p><h3 id="Cost-Savings"><a href="#Cost-Savings" class="headerlink" title="Cost Savings"></a>Cost Savings</h3><p>When it comes to CAT instruments, precision and efficiency work together to produce substantial cost savings. Think about this: more productive workflows reduce the need for time-consuming manual translations. Every translation project becomes an accomplishment to the wise investment made in CAT tools as you maximize your resources and reduce the margin for mistake, opening you a world of unmatched value and affordability.</p><h2 id="TMS-and-CAT-tools-what-is-different"><a href="#TMS-and-CAT-tools-what-is-different" class="headerlink" title="TMS and CAT tools, what is different? "></a>TMS and CAT tools, what is different? <a name="tms"></a></h2><p>TMS and CAT tools play distinct roles in translation workflows, with CAT often being a component of TMS. <a href="../tms/" title="Translation management systems (TMS)">Translation management systems (TMS)</a> oversee project logistics, while Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) tools provide specialized support to translators. CAT tools, commonly integrated within TMS platforms, offer features like translation memory and glossary management, enhancing efficiency and consistency in translation tasks.</p><h2 id="Choosing-the-right-CAT-tool-a-buyer-39-s-guide"><a href="#Choosing-the-right-CAT-tool-a-buyer-39-s-guide" class="headerlink" title="Choosing the right CAT tool: a buyer&#39;s guide "></a>Choosing the right CAT tool: a buyer&#39;s guide <a name="choosing"></a></h2><p>When selecting a Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) tool, consider the following factors to ensure it aligns with your needs:</p><h3 id="Translation-Needs"><a href="#Translation-Needs" class="headerlink" title="Translation Needs:"></a>Translation Needs:</h3><p>Assess your translation requirements, including languages, file formats, and volume, to ensure the CAT tool can accommodate them.</p><p><strong>Why choose Locize:</strong> Locize supports multiple languages and file formats, ensuring compatibility with diverse translation needs and volumes.</p><h3 id="Features"><a href="#Features" class="headerlink" title="Features:"></a>Features:</h3><p>Look for essential features such as translation memory, glossary management, and integration with machine translation, as well as advanced capabilities like terminology extraction and quality assurance checks.</p><p><strong>Why choose Locize:</strong> Locize provides essential features such as translation memory and glossary management, ensuring consistency and efficiency in translations.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="market-expansion-strategy.webp" alt="market expansion strategy"></p><p>Expansion can bring many benefits. Ultimately, it aims to penetrate a new market or address a new target group. </p><p>By expanding your business activities, you lay the foundation for sustainable growth and increasing sales of your products or services. </p><p>However, before you start your project, you need good preparation. And this is where the Market Expansion Strategy comes into play. Without it, it will be difficult to expand successfully.</p><p>But what does a market expansion strategy look like, what advantages does it bring and what options do you have? </p><p>Let&#39;s get started.</p><h2 id="Table-of-contents"><a href="#Table-of-contents" class="headerlink" title="Table of contents"></a>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#what">What is a market expansion strategy?</a></li><li><a href="#why">Why consider market expansion?</a></li><li><a href="#advantages">What are the advantages of a market expansion strategy?</a></li><li><a href="#strategies">What market expansion strategies are there?</a></li><li><a href="#howto">How to go about developing a market expansion strategy?</a></li><li><a href="#failure">What if the market expansion strategy fails?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-is-a-market-expansion-strategy"><a href="#What-is-a-market-expansion-strategy" class="headerlink" title="What is a market expansion strategy? "></a>What is a market expansion strategy? <a name="what"></a></h2><p>A market expansion strategy is a strategic plan to expand your business into a new market. You are tapping into a customer segment that you have not previously addressed with your products or services. Overall, market expansion strategies are actually your maps that show you the way, be it geographically and/or in relation to a target group, to growth, increased sales and market placement.</p><h2 id="Why-consider-market-expansion"><a href="#Why-consider-market-expansion" class="headerlink" title="Why consider market expansion? "></a>Why consider market expansion? <a name="why"></a></h2><p>There are various reasons why a company decides to expand its market. One of the most frequently mentioned is increasing sales. </p><p>Especially if your own market is saturated, it is worth thinking outside the box and expanding into a target market where demand and, as a result, sales potential are still high.</p><p>Usually, a business starts in a specific region or offers everything in English.<br />So basically, it starts with one language only.</p><p>Now think about offering your content in other languages, starting with your website.<br /><br /><b>Do you think this is not relevant?</b><br /><br />Ok, then consider <a href="https://insights.csa-research.com/reportaction/305013126/Marketing">this article</a>. </p><p>According to it, 40% of consumers say they will never purchase from a website not in their native language. </p><p>While 75% say they are more likely to use a business again if aftersales care is in their native language.</p><p>Effective localization ensures your product meets the needs of your demographics and helps you reach new audiences.</p><p>With nearly five billion smartphone users globally, the localization of apps and websites ensures customers can enjoy your product wherever they are.</p><p>You won&#39;t add or change any features. You simply offer what you have in a few more languages.</p><p>Here are the top 10 most spoken languages in the world:</p><ol><li>Chinese — 1.3 Billion Native Speakers</li><li>Spanish — 471 Million Native Speakers</li><li>English — 370 Million Native Speakers</li><li>Hindi — 342 Million Native Speakers</li><li>Arabic — 315 Million Native Speakers</li><li>Portuguese — 232 Million Native Speakers</li><li>Bengali — 229 Million Native Speakers</li><li>Russian — 154 Million Native Speakers</li><li>Japanese — 126 Million Native Speakers</li><li>Lahnda (Western Punjabi) — 118 Million Native Speakers</li></ol><p>When we count the top 10 most spoken languages according to the total number of people who speak them (whether or not the language is their mother tongue), it looks slightly different:</p><ol><li>English — 1.348 billion total speakers</li><li>Mandarin Chinese — 1.120 billion total speakers</li><li>Hindi — 600 million total speakers</li><li>Spanish — 543 million total speakers</li><li>Standard Arabic — 274 million total speakers</li><li>Bengali — 268 million total speakers</li><li>French — 267 million total speakers</li><li>Russian — 258 million total speakers</li><li>Portuguese — 258 million total speakers</li><li>Urdu — 230 million total speakers</li></ol><p>A little mind experiment: What if you offered your website and product in Chinese, Hindi, and Spanish, besides English?</p><p><b>You would target an additional audience of 2.266 billion speakers.This makes a potential growth of 268%!</b></p><p>With a market expansion strategy in hand, diversification always goes hand in hand. This gives you the significant advantage of spreading the risk that you have when you only depend on one market. Even in the face of fluctuations in the economy, political events or the unforeseeable, your company remains much more robust.</p><p>Also take advantage of the economy of scale. By spreading your expenses over a larger output, you can multiply your efficiency but reduce your costs in the long term.</p><p>Being present in multiple markets inevitably leads to greater visibility and therefore greater brand awareness. This means that not only sales but also the market value increase. At the same time, you can keep up with your competitors or even set yourself apart from them.</p><p>From an even different perspective, market expansion gives you access to new talent that can prevent a shortage of skilled workers. You may also discover new, advanced technologies and business practices in a new market that you were not aware of before, but that could significantly increase your productivity and competitiveness.</p><h2 id="What-are-the-advantages-of-a-market-expansion-strategy"><a href="#What-are-the-advantages-of-a-market-expansion-strategy" class="headerlink" title="What are the advantages of a market expansion strategy? "></a>What are the advantages of a market expansion strategy? <a name="advantages"></a></h2><p>A well-planned market expansion strategy is, to put it bluntly, half the battle when it comes to your expansion. Above all, it helps you achieve your long-term goals and ensure that your growth is continuous but controlled.</p><p>Advantages of a Market Expansion Strategy are:</p><h3 id="1-Risk-reduction"><a href="#1-Risk-reduction" class="headerlink" title="1. Risk reduction"></a>1. Risk reduction</h3><p>By carrying out market research and analysis and starting pilot projects in a market expansion strategy, you can avoid possible risks of market expansionProactively identify, take appropriate countermeasures and thus minimize them. With a strategic approach, you avoid having to pay expensive fees and at the same time increase the likelihood of a successful market entry.</p><h3 id="2-Resource-allocation"><a href="#2-Resource-allocation" class="headerlink" title="2. Resource allocation"></a>2. Resource allocation</h3><p>Your resources, be it capital, staff or time, are limited. So that you can really use this effectively for your expansion, a market expansion strategy is essential. For example, you can identify the most attractive markets in advance, use the economies of scale and create synergies between different markets and your business areas.</p><h3 id="3-Competitive-advantage"><a href="#3-Competitive-advantage" class="headerlink" title="3. Competitive advantage"></a>3. Competitive advantage</h3><p>If your market expansion strategy is successful and you open up new markets, you will build sustainable competitive advantages. In other words, a market expansion strategy enables you to meaningfully differentiate your products and services from your competitors, to establish them strongly in the market and to build a loyal customer base.</p><h3 id="4-Innovation-and-learning"><a href="#4-Innovation-and-learning" class="headerlink" title="4. Innovation and learning"></a>4. Innovation and learning</h3><p>In addition to the advantages of risk minimization or resource distribution, a market expansion strategy always promotes internal company development, which you should not despise. Ultimately, a market expansion strategy requires new ideas, progressive business models and engagement with other cultures, target groups and competitors.</p><p>Market expansion can also mean that you have to optimize your products or services for the new market or even be inspired to create completely new ones. Furthermore, the experience and knowledge that you will gain from the expansion will be available to you in the long term, which you can then transfer to other areas of your company.</p><h3 id="5-Brand-perception-and-the-global-image"><a href="#5-Brand-perception-and-the-global-image" class="headerlink" title="5. Brand perception and the global image"></a>5. Brand perception and the global image</h3><p>An equally notable advantage of a market expansion strategy is that you can use market expansion to build up your image and the perception of your brand in a controlled manner. Be it with an international market expansion strategy or global market expansion strategies. Once the foundation has been laid, you can strengthen the trust of customers, investors and business partners and manage the entire process yourself, which contributes significantly to ensuring a reasonable reputation.</p><h2 id="What-market-expansion-strategies-are-there"><a href="#What-market-expansion-strategies-are-there" class="headerlink" title="What market expansion strategies are there? "></a>What market expansion strategies are there? <a name="strategies"></a></h2><p>A distinction is made between four market expansion strategies that you can use depending on your goals:</p><ul><li>Market penetration</li><li>Product development</li><li>Market development</li><li>Diversification</li></ul><p>Fortunately, these are not just purely theoretical approaches, but rather market expansion strategies that you can immediately implement in practice. We&#39;ll tell you what this might look like in the next sections.</p><h3 id="Market-penetration-existing-product-existing-market"><a href="#Market-penetration-existing-product-existing-market" class="headerlink" title="Market penetration (existing product, existing market)"></a>Market penetration (existing product, existing market)</h3><p>With market penetration as your market expansion strategy, you focus on strengthening your existing products or services in your current market and increasing their sales. Ergo, you try to sell more of what you offer - be it to existing customers or new customers. The approach is often the first step that companies implement as part of their market expansion strategy. Importantly, market penetration only works effectively if the market is not yet saturated. However, your risk remains low because you neither venture into unknown territory nor have to spend a lot of money. What helps you with this market expansion strategy with the goals of increasing market share, competitiveness and profit maximization are pricing strategies, advertising campaigns, sales promotions or improving services such as customer service. However, the growth potential remains manageable with this approach.</p><p>A classic example of market penetration is a company lowering its prices to attract more customers. A wireless carrier offers discounts or improved tariff plans to attract or persuade customers to switch from a competitor.</p><h3 id="Product-development-new-product-existing-market"><a href="#Product-development-new-product-existing-market" class="headerlink" title="Product development (new product, existing market)"></a>Product development (new product, existing market)</h3><p>When developing products as part of your market expansion strategy, you optimize your existing products and services for your market, modify variants or introduce a completely new offering. The aim is to better penetrate your existing markets or open up new market segments. This can be achieved by focusing on increasing customer value for your product range. With this market expansion strategy, always make sure that you take customer wishes into account in all innovations and improvements in order to stand out from your competitors in the long term.</p><p>Since you have to spend a little more money on product development, the risk also increases compared to market penetration. To avoid bad investments, you can pursue the virtual prototyping approach. You test your innovation BEFORE the actual development within a virtual environment under completely real conditions and marketing levels. This includes setting up a web presence.</p><p>An example of product development is introducing a new smartphone model with improved features and performance to encourage existing fans to upgrade and attract new, tech-savvy customers. An outstanding role model for such a market expansion strategy is undoubtedly Apple.</p><h3 id="Market-development-existing-product-new-market"><a href="#Market-development-existing-product-new-market" class="headerlink" title="Market development (existing product, new market)"></a>Market development (existing product, new market)</h3><p>Do you have an excellent product and want to conquer a new sales market? Then market development is your market expansion strategy. In market development, you strive to take your existing products or services into new markets. This can mean both geographical expansion (domestic or international) as well as addressing new target groups or opening up additional sales channels. The main goal is to discover new sales potential and expand your customer base. One advantage of this market expansion strategy is that you don&#39;t have to spend any money on further developing your products. However, market developments require that you have a thorough knowledge of the new field, its players, opponents and spectators. Furthermore, it is essential to carry out very finely graded target group marketing, which takes the respective cultural characteristics into account.</p><p>An example would be a food company that wants to sell its products internationally to reach new geographical markets.</p><h3 id="Diversification-new-product-new-market"><a href="#Diversification-new-product-new-market" class="headerlink" title="Diversification (new product, new market)"></a>Diversification (new product, new market)</h3><p>Probably the most comprehensive, risky, but also, if successful, strongest market expansion strategy is diversification. This means you are introducing a new product to a new market. There are two main types of diversification: related and unrelated diversification. With related diversification, you expand your offerings into areas that are logically related to your current environments. With unrelated diversification, you enter completely new business areas that have no direct connection to your previous activities. Note that these market expansion strategies involve an investment of money and time. However, if the equation of the two unknowns works out, the effort will undoubtedly have been worth it due to the enormous increase in sales.</p><p>An example of diversification would be a clothing manufacturer starting to produce and sell sports equipment - if this is related diversification - or entering the technology industry - if it is an unrelated diversification.</p><p>If you can&#39;t decide between the four market expansion strategies or would like to benefit from the advantages of several strategies, there are intermediate solutions:</p><ul><li>Market expansion: strategy of selling established products within new geographical markets while maintaining target group consistency.</li><li>Product Modification: Approach to bridging the gap between market penetration and product development by making slight adjustments to existing products to reintroduce them into the current market.</li><li>Limited diversification: adapting existing products to enter new geographical markets.</li><li>Partial diversification: strategy that involves either distributing new products into geographically new markets or introducing modified products to new target groups.</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-go-about-developing-a-market-expansion-strategy"><a href="#How-to-go-about-developing-a-market-expansion-strategy" class="headerlink" title="How to go about developing a market expansion strategy? "></a>How to go about developing a market expansion strategy? <a name="howto"></a></h2><p>Now you know what a market expansion strategy is, its advantages and its four common models. Now let&#39;s get to one of the most interesting parts: How do you develop such a strategy in practice?</p><p><img src="../market-expansion/SMART-goals-definition.png" alt="set the goals"></p><h3 id="1-Set-the-goals"><a href="#1-Set-the-goals" class="headerlink" title="1. Set the goals"></a>1. Set the goals</h3><p>Before starting your market expansion, you should set clear, measurable and realistic goals. All goals should address different aspects of your expansion, including sales, market share, customer acquisition, and brand awareness. Use the SMART principle when setting goals.</p><p>What are <a href="https://www.bitesizelearning.co.uk/resources/smart-goals-meaning-examples" title="SMART goals">SMART goals</a>?</p><p><b>Specific</b>: Define exactly what you want to achieve in each new market. For example, you could aim to achieve a certain level of sales or capture a certain percentage of market share within the first year of entering the market.</p><p><b>Measurable</b>: Make sure you can quantify your goals. This allows you to track progress over the long term and measure your successes. Examples of measurable goals could be: selling 10,000 units of your product in the first year or acquiring 500 new customers in the first six months.</p><p><b>Attainable</b>: Your goals should be challenging but realistic. To do this, consider your resources, competition and market conditions.</p><p><b>Relevant</b>: All of your goals should be closely tied to your company&#39;s overall business goals and overall strategy. They should help carry and support your company’s long-term vision and mission.</p><p><b>Timely</b>: Set clear deadlines for achieving your goals. Timelines help you stay motivated, plan and monitor progress.</p><p>A complete example goal according to the SMART variant could be: “We increase sales by 20% within one year of market entry by selling product X in the new target market Y.”</p><p>This goal is specific (increase revenue by selling a specific product), measurable (20% increase in revenue), achievable (based on a realistic estimate), relevant (contributes to overall revenue growth), and time-bound (within a year).</p><p>By incorporating clearly defined goals into your market expansion strategy, you can better measure the success of your measures and ensure that all activities are aimed at achieving these goals - and, above all, remain so.</p><h3 id="2-Market-research-and-analysis"><a href="#2-Market-research-and-analysis" class="headerlink" title="2. Market research and analysis"></a>2. Market research and analysis</h3><p>Once your goals are clear, the Market Expansion Strategy involves creating a comprehensive analysis of potential new markets. Take a close look at demographics, economic indicators, cultural differences, legal frameworks and technological developments. Study the competitive landscape to understand your competitors&#39; strengths and weaknesses and identify gaps in the market that you may be able to exploit.</p><ul><li>Use online resources such as <a href="https://de.statista.com/" title="Statista">Statista</a>, <a href="https://marketresearch.com/" title="MarketResearch.com">MarketResearch.com</a> or national statistical authorities to collect relevant market data.</li><li>Conduct surveys or focus groups with potential customers to get direct feedback and understand customer segments.</li><li>Analyze social media and customer reviews to gain insight into trends and preferences.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Define-target-market"><a href="#3-Define-target-market" class="headerlink" title="3. Define target market"></a>3. Define target market</h3><p>Based on your market research, you should now be able to select the most attractive markets for your market expansion strategy. Your decision will be based on factors such as market size, accessibility, growth potential and fit with your product or service offering. Always take your own company goals and resources into account.</p><ul><li>Create a ranking of your preferred markets based on quantitative and qualitative criteria.</li><li>Consider market entry costs and operational costs in different markets.</li><li>Conduct a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis for each potential market.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Develop-market-entry-strategy"><a href="#4-Develop-market-entry-strategy" class="headerlink" title="4. Develop market entry strategy"></a>4. Develop market entry strategy</h3><p>Is your new target market located? We are entering the hot phase of the market expansion strategy. Decide now how you want to enter the market: through export, licensing, franchising, setting up a subsidiary, partnership or acquisition. Each of these options entails different investment requirements, risks and levels of control. So take your time and look at each of the options carefully.</p><ul><li>Consider establishing strategic partnerships or joint ventures with local companies to overcome potential barriers to entry.</li><li>Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each market entry option in light of your business goals and resources.</li><li>Consult local experts or advisors to be able to meet legal and regulatory requirements later.</li></ul><h3 id="5-Adjust-marketing-and-sales-strategy"><a href="#5-Adjust-marketing-and-sales-strategy" class="headerlink" title="5. Adjust marketing and sales strategy"></a>5. Adjust marketing and sales strategy</h3><p>Of course, you want to reach your target group as quickly as possible after entering the market. This is achieved by designing marketing and sales strategies that are specifically tailored to the target market. Take cultural characteristics, language, local trends and target group behavior into account. Adjust your product offerings, pricing models, advertising messages and sales channels accordingly.</p><ul><li>Develop culture-specific marketing materials and campaigns that resonate with the target market.</li><li>Carefully select sales and distribution partners who have good knowledge of the local market.</li><li>Use digital marketing and social media to effectively reach your target audience.</li></ul><h4 id="Website-and-translation-management"><a href="#Website-and-translation-management" class="headerlink" title="Website and translation management"></a>Website and translation management</h4><p>Your market expansion strategy should prioritize the establishment of a comprehensive localization strategy. This involves the adoption of a sophisticated translation management system (TMS) and a well-orchestrated approach to localization that ensures your website resonates with the target audience both linguistically and culturally.</p><p>Invest in a robust <a href="/blog/tms/" title="translation management system">translation management system</a> that streamlines the localization process, ensuring efficiency and consistency across all digital content. A TMS can facilitate collaboration among translators, editors, and project managers, significantly reducing the time and effort required for large-scale localization projects.</p><p>Develop a localization strategy that extends beyond mere translation. Understand the cultural nuances, consumer behaviors, and market trends of your target region. This strategy should encompass local customs, values, and preferences, ensuring that your website, from content to visuals, aligns with the local culture.</p><p>Collaboration with local experts or <a href="https://locize.com/services.html" title="professional translators">professional translators</a> is crucial for achieving authentic and culturally relevant content. They can provide insights into local expressions, units of measurement, holidays, and other cultural specifics, enhancing the local appeal of your website.</p><p>Emphasize the adaptation of your digital presence to mobile platforms, considering the predominant use of mobile internet in many target markets. A mobile-optimized website is not just a preference but a necessity for reaching a wider audience.</p><p>Incorporate local customer feedback and analytics into your strategy to continuously refine and optimize your localized content. This feedback loop can identify areas for improvement, helping you better cater to the local audience&#39;s needs and preferences.</p><p>Engaging with a specialized agency can offer valuable expertise in both localization and the technical aspects required for a successful international web presence. Such partnerships provide access to specialized skills and knowledge, from professional translations to technical optimizations, ensuring that your localization strategy is effectively implemented and aligned with your business objectives.</p><p>By prioritizing a translation management system and a comprehensive localization strategy, you position your business for success in new markets by ensuring your digital content is accessible, relevant, and engaging to your target audience. This approach not only enhances brand perception but also fosters trust and loyalty among local customers.</p><p>➡️ Create a free new <a href="https://www.locize.app/register">user account</a> for a transformative localization experience</p><h3 id="6-Operations-and-supply-chain-management"><a href="#6-Operations-and-supply-chain-management" class="headerlink" title="6. Operations and supply chain management"></a>6. Operations and supply chain management</h3><p>Every market expansion strategy also requires you to plan your logistics and the associated operational processes in detail. There are few things today that have a more negative impact on your success than an inefficient supply chain. Ultimately, it&#39;s about customer service. And they are now used to receiving everything without long delivery times or detours. Also take local specifics such as logistics, customs, taxes and labor into account.</p><ul><li>Establish robust supply chain processes and work with reliable, local suppliers and logistics partners.</li><li>Comply with local regulations and standards regarding production, packaging and labeling.</li><li>Implement effective inventory and warehousing management to avoid supply shortages.</li></ul><h3 id="6-Financial-planning"><a href="#6-Financial-planning" class="headerlink" title="6. Financial planning"></a>6. Financial planning</h3><p>With a market expansion you are of course also aiming for an increase in sales. Accordingly, part of your market expansion strategy is to prepare detailed financial forecasts and set budgets. Take into account both one-off costs (e.g. market entry costs) and ongoing operating costs. Also plan buffers for unexpected expenses and potential currency risks.</p><ul><li>Include financial models in your market expansion strategy to run through different scenarios and see how different market situations affect your finances.</li><li>Secure sufficient financing and liquidity to support the expansion phase.</li><li>Implement an effective cost control and monitoring system to keep track of your finances.</li></ul><h3 id="7-Monitoring-and-adjustment"><a href="#7-Monitoring-and-adjustment" class="headerlink" title="7. Monitoring and adjustment"></a>7. Monitoring and adjustment</h3><p>The basis for your long-term success in a new market is continuous monitoring and evaluation of your activities. Within the Market Expansion Strategy, you should consider the progress of your set goals, both your market performance and performance, and customer feedback. It&#39;s important that you collect quantitative and qualitative data to get a complete picture of your expansion.</p><ul><li>Use CRM systems, analytics tools and financial reporting to track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, market share, customer acquisition and customer satisfaction.</li><li>Schedule regular sessions (e.g. monthly or quarterly) to assess and discuss progress. To do this, you put together a team from different areas to include different perspectives.</li><li>Actively collect feedback from customers, partners and employees in the new market. Use surveys, customer interviews and market research to gain insights into market reaction and customer needs.</li></ul><p>But also be prepared to adjust your market expansion strategy based on the results. Be prepared for changes to products, marketing approaches or even the entire market entry strategy.</p><h2 id="What-if-the-market-expansion-strategy-fails"><a href="#What-if-the-market-expansion-strategy-fails" class="headerlink" title="What if the market expansion strategy fails? "></a>What if the market expansion strategy fails? <a name="failure"></a></h2><p>If your market expansion strategy fails, it is important not to lose heart or jump to conclusions. Failure is a natural part of entrepreneurship and holds valuable lessons that will help improve your future market expansion strategy.</p><p>First, you should conduct a thorough analysis to identify the reasons for the failure of your market expansion strategy. Illuminate all aspects of your market expansion strategy, from market research and target group analysis to marketing and sales. Take a close look at which assumptions were wrong, which approaches didn&#39;t work, and whether external factors such as economic changes or unforeseen events played a role.</p><p>Use this opportunity to learn from your mistakes and optimize your market expansion strategy. This might mean better understanding your audiences, adapting your products or services, or rethinking your marketing and sales efforts. Based on your analysis and the insights gained, you can then adjust your market expansion strategy accordingly. This means both minor optimizations and a comprehensive revision of your market expansion strategy plans. Be open to change and willing to try completely new things.</p><p>After you&#39;ve refocused your market expansion strategy, develop a new plan for entering the market or refocusing your operations. To do this, set yourself realistic goals and milestones and make sure that you have sufficient resources for implementation.</p><p>It should be said again: failure is not a reason to give up. Many successful companies initially failed before they found their way to success. Maintain your resolve and stay committed to pursuing your business goals.</p><p>What&#39;s important is that you learn from every failure and use this unique knowledge to improve your future endeavors. By remaining resilient and willing to adapt and learn, you can increase your chances of future success.</p>]]></content>

Until one of the translation suggestions is accepted, the actual value won't change.</p></div><h3 id="Managing-terminology"><a href="#Managing-terminology" class="headerlink" title="Managing terminology"></a>Managing terminology</h3><p>Terminology is the fundamental cornerstone of all translations. To describe objects and form sentences, people use words, phrases, and jargon. </p><p>If your content generation has to be extended, certain criteria for managing material must be established for all parties involved. </p><p>You should keep track of terms that should or shouldn&#39;t be translated via a glossary. It exists to facilitate the use of the language that your business likes by human translators.</p><h3 id="Use-the-translation-memory"><a href="#Use-the-translation-memory" class="headerlink" title="Use the translation memory"></a>Use the translation memory</h3><p>A TMS&#39;s translation memory feature is especially crucial since it greatly boosts the productivity of language localization <a href="/blog/language-localization/" title="language localization">language localization</a>. </p><p>You can utilize words and phrases from previous work rather than coming up with new language every time. To assist human translators, sentences that have already been translated are stored in a database called a translation memory (TM).</p><h3 id="Get-the-history-and-numbers"><a href="#Get-the-history-and-numbers" class="headerlink" title="Get the history and numbers"></a>Get the history and numbers</h3><p>Every project management tool must provide the most crucial indicators about budget, progress, and other factors.</p><p>The majority of the tasks are contained in one program by the TMS. As a result, reporting the numbers is a must. The data insights from the TMS help improve the administration of your localization projects.</p><p>Additionally, keeping track of all previous translations might be helpful. In the event of an inconvenience, it is possible to demonstrate at any moment who made what changes and when.</p><p>Locize, our translation management system, offers an overview of the control center with the key figures for the ongoing project:</p><p>The control center of our <a href="/" title="localization software">localization software</a> displays all pertinent high-level data:</p><ul><li>user management</li><li>billing (customer details, billing history, budget limit, ...)</li><li>project settings (slack integration, webhook, integration metrics, ...)</li><li>ordering (services, pending orders)</li><li>branches</li><li>project health and metrics</li></ul><h3 id="Auto-Machine-Translation"><a href="#Auto-Machine-Translation" class="headerlink" title="Auto Machine Translation"></a>Auto Machine Translation</h3><p>With this capability, the TMS attempts to entirely automate the translation process. Traditionally, an application program interface (API) is used to connect translated texts to an engine that handles the translation automatically. </p><p>Because the results from artificial intelligence are typically not 100% fine, a translator is frequently needed to evaluate the auto translation output. Read more in the <a href="/blog/ai-in-localization" title="AI in Localization">AI in Localization</a> article. </p><p>For locize, the entire automatic machine translation process occurs in the backend, which means you&#39;ll see the translated result after saving the new keys in reference language.</p><h4 id="Should-you-choose-machine-translation-a-translation-agency-or-a-freelancer"><a href="#Should-you-choose-machine-translation-a-translation-agency-or-a-freelancer" class="headerlink" title="Should you choose machine translation, a translation agency or a freelancer?"></a>Should you choose machine translation, a translation agency or a freelancer?</h4><p>These are three options when there is a need of translating content. Whether to engage a translation agency, a freelancer, or make use of machine translation. </p><p>Machine translation would be the most cost-effective approach because it is virtually free. However, if no one reviews the translated information, there will undoubtedly be a lack of transaltion quality.</p><p>Freelance translators are frequently enthusiastic about their work. They are frequently subject specialists who can execute sophisticated translations in their fields. This might be a wonderful alternative for those on a restricted budget. Working with a person rather than a firm is less expensive, and you don&#39;t have to sacrifice quality.</p><p>Translation agencies have greater resources to devote to your job than a freelancer.

They automate project procedures after putting in place a TMS, which significantly shortens project turnaround times. Weeks-long tasks can now be finished in a matter of days. This increased productivity enables the business to reallocate important resources, which is especially important in a situation when there is a shortage of trained labor. For instance, Company A reports a 25% gain in revenue in addition to completing 30% more tasks per month after implementing a TMS.</p><h3 id="20-lower-expenses-to-reinvest-in-growing-the-company"><a href="#20-lower-expenses-to-reinvest-in-growing-the-company" class="headerlink" title="20% lower expenses to reinvest in growing the company"></a>20% lower expenses to reinvest in growing the company</h3><p>Without a TMS, project management can be labor-intensive and costly. By simplifying project administration and automating key tasks, a TMS minimizes administrative overhead. For example, Company B cut its project management costs by 20% after implementing a TMS, directly contributing to profit growth. These cost savings can be reinvested in business expansion, technology upgrades, or boosting the bottom line.</p><h3 id="25-increase-in-revenue-as-demand-rises"><a href="#25-increase-in-revenue-as-demand-rises" class="headerlink" title="25% increase in revenue as demand rises"></a>25% increase in revenue as demand rises</h3><p>Company C was looking to expand its client base and take on more translation projects. However, they were concerned about managing increased workloads effectively. By adopting a TMS with robust scalability, they could effortlessly accommodate the growing demand. The TMS allowed them to streamline workflows and maintain efficiency as their client base expanded. The result? A 25% growth in revenue within a year.</p><h3 id="40-more-recurring-business-with-higher-quality"><a href="#40-more-recurring-business-with-higher-quality" class="headerlink" title="40% more recurring business with higher quality"></a>40% more recurring business with higher quality</h3><p>Consistency and quality in translation are pivotal to client satisfaction. By storing translation memories and terminology databases, a TMS ensures consistent, high-quality translations. When clients receive accurate and reliable translations on every project, they become loyal customers. For instance, Company D witnessed a 40% increase in repeat business due to the improved quality of translations made possible by their TMS.</p><h3 id="20-of-revenue-boost-in-global-markets"><a href="#20-of-revenue-boost-in-global-markets" class="headerlink" title="20% of revenue boost in global markets"></a>20% of revenue boost in global markets</h3><p>Company E was focused on a domestic market.

    <title>Is SDL Trados Still Relevant in Today’s Localization Landscape?</title>
    <link href="https://locize.com/blog/is-sdl-trados-still-relevant/"/>
    <id>https://locize.com/blog/is-sdl-trados-still-relevant/</id>
    <published>2023-10-31T23:00:00.000Z</published>
    <updated>2023-11-01T11:54:24.419Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="title.jpg"></p><p>In the field of translation and localization, there is one tool that has been dominant for decades: SDL Trados. This software has been a staple for translators and language service providers (LSPs) alike, offering a suite of features that streamline translation workflows and improve overall productivity. However, as the translation industry evolves and new technologies emerge, some are questioning whether SDL Trados is still relevant in today&#39;s localization landscape. In this article, we&#39;ll explore this question and take a closer look at SDL Trados, its advantages and disadvantages, and why some are turning to more modern translation management systems.</p><h2 id="What-is-SDL-Trados"><a href="#What-is-SDL-Trados" class="headerlink" title="What is SDL Trados?"></a>What is SDL Trados?</h2><p>SDL Trados is a translation memory software developed by SDL, a company that specializes in language technology and services. The software is widely used by translators and LSPs to manage translation workflows and improve translation quality. SDL Trados offers a range of features, including translation memory, terminology management, and automated workflows, all designed to improve efficiency and productivity in the translation process.</p><h2 id="Advantages-of-SDL-Trados"><a href="#Advantages-of-SDL-Trados" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of SDL Trados"></a>Advantages of SDL Trados</h2><h3 id="Translation-memory"><a href="#Translation-memory" class="headerlink" title="Translation memory"></a>Translation memory</h3><p>One of the key advantages of SDL Trados is its translation memory (TM) functionality. Translation memory is a database that stores previously translated content, allowing translators to reuse translations for repeated phrases and sentences. This can greatly reduce translation time and costs while improving consistency across translations.</p><h3 id="Terminology-management"><a href="#Terminology-management" class="headerlink" title="Terminology management"></a>Terminology management</h3><p>Another advantage of SDL Trados is its terminology management feature. This allows users to create and manage glossaries of key terms specific to their industry or project, ensuring consistency and accuracy across translations.</p><h3 id="Automated-workflows"><a href="#Automated-workflows" class="headerlink" title="Automated workflows"></a>Automated workflows</h3><p>SDL Trados also offers automated workflows, which can save significant time and effort in the translation process. For example, the software can automatically detect file formats, segment content, and suggest translations based on the translation memory and terminology database. This can speed up the translation process and reduce the risk of errors.</p><h2 id="Disadvantages-of-SDL-Trados"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-SDL-Trados" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of SDL Trados"></a>Disadvantages of SDL Trados</h2><h3 id="Expensive-licensing-fees"><a href="#Expensive-licensing-fees" class="headerlink" title="Expensive licensing fees"></a>Expensive licensing fees</h3><p>One of the main disadvantages of SDL Trados is its licensing fees. The software can be very expensive, especially for freelancers or small businesses. The licensing structure can also be complex, making it difficult for users to choose the right package for their needs.</p><h3 id="Complex-interface"><a href="#Complex-interface" class="headerlink" title="Complex interface"></a>Complex interface</h3><p>SDL Trados can also be complex to use, especially for new users. The interface can be overwhelming, and it may take some time to learn how to use all of the features effectively.</p><h3 id="Not-cloud-based"><a href="#Not-cloud-based" class="headerlink" title="Not cloud-based"></a>Not cloud-based</h3><p>Finally, SDL Trados is not cloud-based, meaning that users must install the software on their local machines. This can limit collaboration and accessibility, especially for teams working remotely.</p><h2 id="Alternatives-to-SDL-Trados"><a href="#Alternatives-to-SDL-Trados" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to SDL Trados"></a>Alternatives to SDL Trados</h2><p>As the translation industry evolves, new technologies are emerging that offer alternatives to SDL Trados. One of the most popular alternatives is cloud-based translation management systems, which offer greater collaboration and accessibility. One such system is <a href="/">locize</a>, which offers a range of features similar to SDL Trados but is entirely cloud-based.</p><h3 id="Cloud-based-solutions"><a href="#Cloud-based-solutions" class="headerlink" title="Cloud-based solutions"></a>Cloud-based solutions</h3><p>Cloud-based translation management systems, such as <a href="/">locize</a>, offer several advantages over traditional software like SDL Trados. For one, they can be accessed from anywhere, making them ideal for remote teams or teams working across different locations. They also offer greater collaboration features, such as real-time translation memory updates and more streamlined communication among team members. Another special advantage of <a href="/">locize</a> is the way it can be directly integrated to your software or website, this way translators can modify translations <a href="https://youtu.be/YQryHo1iHb8">without the need</a> to ask the developers to adapt their code or to redeploy their software or website. In addition, cloud-based systems often have lower upfront costs and are more scalable, allowing companies to pay only for what they need as they grow.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>While SDL Trados has been a dominant force in the translation industry for many years, it may no longer be the best fit for all companies. As the industry evolves, it is important to consider newer, cloud-based alternatives like <a href="/">locize</a> that offer greater collaboration, accessibility, and scalability. Ultimately, the best translation management system will depend on the specific needs of your company, so it is important to carefully evaluate the options before making a decision.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="localization.webp" alt="what is localization"></p><p>If you are asking yourself, <strong>what is localization</strong>, then this blog is here to help you. We take a closer look at what this means and how it can help you. </p><div style="border-left: 0.5px solid orange;padding: 0.5rem 2rem"><h2 style="color:orange;">What is localization</h2><p style="color:grey;">Localization involves adapting a product or service to align with the language, culture, or preferences of a specific audience. A successful localization effort results in a product or service that seamlessly integrates with the local culture, giving the impression that it was originally created for that specific market.</p></div><p>For international brands and organizations, it is essential in helping to give their customers the very best experience possible. An effective localization-process can transform a business, helping to increase reach and maximize engagements, but what exactly is it?</p><p>Let&#39;s get started.</p><h2 id="Table-of-contents"><a href="#Table-of-contents" class="headerlink" title="Table of contents"></a>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#concept">What is the concept of localization</a></li><li><a href="#examples">Real-life examples of successful localization-efforts</a></li><li><a href="#examples">Information on localization-strategies</a></li><li><a href="#goal">What are the goals of localization</a></li><li><a href="#resources">Resources related to the importance of localization in international markets</a></li><li><a href="#guides">Guides on how to implement localization</a></li><li><a href="#thoughts">Final thoughts</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-does-localization-mean"><a href="#What-does-localization-mean" class="headerlink" title="What does localization mean "></a>What does localization mean <a name="concept"></a></h2><p>So while language translation is the process of converting written content from one language into another, localization goes beyond this. It will look at things such as:</p><h3 id="Language"><a href="#Language" class="headerlink" title="Language"></a>Language</h3><p>Translating text and ensuring it&#39;s culturally appropriate, considering idiomatic expressions, slang, and terminology specific to the target language.</p><h3 id="Content-Adaptation"><a href="#Content-Adaptation" class="headerlink" title="Content Adaptation"></a>Content Adaptation</h3><p>Adapting content to align with the cultural norms, beliefs, and values of the target audience. This includes imagery, symbols, colors, and references that might be sensitive or offensive in a particular culture.</p><h3 id="Regional-Preferences"><a href="#Regional-Preferences" class="headerlink" title="Regional Preferences"></a>Regional Preferences</h3><p>Customizing the product or content to cater to regional preferences, such as date formats, currencies, units of measurement, and other regional differences.</p><h3 id="User-Interface-UI"><a href="#User-Interface-UI" class="headerlink" title="User Interface (UI)"></a>User Interface (UI)</h3><p>Adjusting the user interface, layout, and design to accommodate different languages and reading directions (e.g., right-to-left for Arabic or Hebrew).</p><h3 id="Legal-and-Regulatory-Compliance"><a href="#Legal-and-Regulatory-Compliance" class="headerlink" title="Legal and Regulatory Compliance"></a>Legal and Regulatory Compliance</h3><p>Ensuring that the product or content complies with local laws, regulations, and industry standards.</p><h3 id="Functionality"><a href="#Functionality" class="headerlink" title="Functionality"></a>Functionality</h3><p>Modifying features or functionality that may not be relevant or practical in the target market or adding features that are specific to that market.</p><h3 id="Testing"><a href="#Testing" class="headerlink" title="Testing"></a>Testing</h3><p>Rigorously testing the localized product or content to identify and resolve issues related to linguistic, cultural, or technical aspects.</p><p>Localization is a crucial strategy for businesses of all sizes because it makes their content more appealing to the audience they are trying to reach. The process of first enabling a product to be localized, then localizing it for various national audiences is sometimes know as <a href="/blog/globalization-vs-localization/" title="globalization">globalization</a>.</p><p>According to <a href="https://insights.csa-research.com/reportaction/305013126/Marketing">this article</a> 40% of consumers have said that they will never purchase from a website that wasn’t in their native language. While 75% have said that they would be more likely to use a business again if their aftersales care was in their native language.</p><p>With the help of this article, you can learn how to adapt your service or product to a specific language, culture, or target market, regardless of the industry you work in. </p><p>Additionally, we will explain how to adapt content or products for various markets and geographical areas.</p><p>But first, let&#39;s look at some successful examples of well-known brands using it.</p><p><img src="populations-look-and-feel.webp" alt="populations look and feel"></p><h2 id="Real-life-examples-of-successful-localization-efforts"><a href="#Real-life-examples-of-successful-localization-efforts" class="headerlink" title="Real-life examples of successful localization-efforts "></a>Real-life examples of successful localization-efforts <a name="examples"></a></h2><div style="display: flex; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 20px;"><div style="flex: 1; margin-right: 20px;">    <img src="airbnb.png" alt="Airbnb Image">    <h3>Business Example</h3>    <p>Internationalization is becoming increasingly more common, and businesses are now interacting with clients and customers from across the globe. Localization should now be an essential part of their growth strategy, covering everything from company websites and marketing materials to legal documents and product manuals.</p>    <p>One great example of this is Airbnb, which has successfully been able to expand its business into over 220 countries, each one offering a personal and localized touch to the consumer.</p>    <span style="font-size:0.7rem">Source: <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" title="airbnb">airbnb</a></span></div><div style="flex: 1;">    <img src="netflix.png" alt="Netflix Image">    <h3>Software Example</h3>    <p>Localization is also a vital strategy in the world of software development. Everything from user experience to overall design will need to be considered to ensure that customers are getting the very best experience.</p>    <p>A good example of software-localization is Netflix. The global streaming giant has become synonymous with efforts on both the translation side of things and on the developer side. The technology and processes that they utilize are translated and localized in every region, meaning the interface and apps change, as do the subtitles and voice dubbing of content. Even the films and TV shows they develop are localized for specific countries.</p>    <span style="font-size:0.7rem">Source: <a href="https://www.netflix.com/" title="netflix">netflix</a></span>  </div></div><div style="border-left: 0.5px solid orange;padding: 0.5rem 2rem"><p style="color:grey;">Check out our more real-life examples <a href="/customers.html" title="Customer Success Stories">on this page</a>.</p></div><h2 id="What-are-the-goals-of-localization"><a href="#What-are-the-goals-of-localization" class="headerlink" title="What are the goals of localization "></a>What are the goals of localization <a name="goal"></a></h2><p>The ultimate goal is to develop a clear user experience that helps to drive your marketing and support you in achieving your goals. However, there are many benefits that can come from implementing it, including:</p><h4 id="Enter-new-markets"><a href="#Enter-new-markets" class="headerlink" title="Enter new markets"></a>Enter new markets</h4><p>One of the main goals of a <a href="/blog/localization-strategy" title="localization-strategy">localization-strategy</a> is to help brands to easily enter new markets. It will help overcome any logistical or legal hurdles, ensuring smooth communication across every partner. </p><h4 id="Secure-a-competitive-edge"><a href="#Secure-a-competitive-edge" class="headerlink" title="Secure a competitive edge"></a>Secure a competitive edge</h4><p>Implementing localization can also help companies to develop a competitive edge. Going against competitors in a local market can be incredibly challenging as they often have the trust of local audiences. It will help you to build that trust, giving you the edge. </p><h4 id="Improve-customer-satisfaction"><a href="#Improve-customer-satisfaction" class="headerlink" title="Improve customer satisfaction"></a>Improve customer satisfaction</h4><p>Another important goal is that it helps to improve customer satisfaction.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="software-localization.webp" alt="software localization" title="Software Localization"></p><p>According to a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/software-localization-market-reach-15-140100165.html" title="recent study">recent study</a>, the global market for software localization generated $5.9 billion in revenue in 2022 and is predicted to grow even more until 2032, when it is predicted to reach $15.6 billion.</p><p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic, as businesses shifted operations online and broadened their global reach as a result of increased business focus on global expansion, this topic has become even more important.</p><p>Software localization can be an expensive process, especially for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) with tight budgets, and it takes time and resources to ensure high-quality results in localization projects. </p><p>What is it about and what benefits can it offer your business?</p><p>If you are faced with this issue, you can get started with these details. </p><p>Let&#39;s go!</p><h2 id="Table-of-contents"><a href="#Table-of-contents" class="headerlink" title="Table of contents"></a>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#what">What is software localization?</a></li><li><a href="#undertaken">How does localization take place?</a></li><li><a href="#important">Why localization of software is important</a></li><li><a href="#process">Successful implementation</a></li><li><a href="#who">Who needs localization of software?</a></li><li><a href="#nextlevel">Test our solution for free</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-is-software-localization"><a href="#What-is-software-localization" class="headerlink" title="What is software localization? "></a>What is software localization? <a name="what"></a></h2><p>Software localization helps to adapt software to the language and circumstances of the target market while retaining its originality. This means that not only is the text being adapted into the relevant language, but the design and overall user experience (UX) are amended to ensure that it meets the needs of the target audience.</p><p>While <a href="../what-is-i18n/">internationalization (i18n)</a> is about developing a product to meet the demands of a specific culture or audience, localization of software is a far more in-depth solution. The process usually requires the complete modification of text and multimedia for a software product. </p><p>For example, trying to localize a piece of software that is in English into Chinese is not simply a case of translating the wording. The length of text and symbols are entirely different, meaning the whole visual layout will need to be amended to ensure the overall user experience (UX) remains the same.</p><p>Software localization goes much further than that, too. It also looks at the resources and links being used, the time- and date-format, the use of images or gestures to ensure they are culturally appropriate, and even the direction the text needs to be read in.</p><p>This makes the whole process incredibly complex and time-consuming process, but it is a worthwhile investment for any developer.</p><h2 id="How-does-localization-take-place"><a href="#How-does-localization-take-place" class="headerlink" title="How does localization take place? "></a>How does localization take place? <a name="undertaken"></a></h2><p>Software can be localised in two core areas, internationsalisation and then localization. The <b>internationalization</b> process <b>covers the design and development</b>, which means you should:</p><ul><li>review your application framework to ensure it can support your requirements</li><li>thoroughly plan your content, including understanding how much space translated text will require. </li><li>incorporate the needs regarding content into the design, helping to make the localization more effective.</li><li>code your strings to allow you to expand when required.</li><li>externalize any strings that have been prepped for localization</li></ul><p>Once you have successfully completed the internationalization phase, you should then begin to incorporate the <b>localization</b> phase. This is <b>the process of translating your content utilizing a skilled translator</b> and ensuring they are covering every part of your software.</p><p>The translation is one of the most important parts of your localization, so once complete, you must thoroughly review everything. This includes checking the accuracy of the content, the quality of the language, and the terminology being used.</p><p>Once finished, you will then need to copy the translations into your software and begin testing it in every locality you are targeting. When you are certain that the software is working as designed and free from bugs, it can then be released to the public.</p><h3 id="Waterfall-vs-continuous-localization-What’s-the-difference"><a href="#Waterfall-vs-continuous-localization-What’s-the-difference" class="headerlink" title="Waterfall vs continuous localization: What’s the difference?"></a>Waterfall vs continuous localization: What’s the difference?</h3><p>For localization of software there are different workflows. The most traditional is to break down the activities into linear sequential phases - the so called waterfall workflow, where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to a specialization of tasks.</p><p><img src="waterfall-workflow.webp" alt="waterfall workflow" title="waterfall workflow"></p><p><a href="/blog/modern-continuous-localization/">Continuous software localization</a> combines software development and localization into one process so that software developers work in parallel with the localization team from the very beginning:</p><p><img src="continous-workflow.webp" alt="continous workflow" title="continous workflow"></p><h2 id="Why-localization-of-software-is-important"><a href="#Why-localization-of-software-is-important" class="headerlink" title="Why localization of software is important? "></a>Why localization of software is important? <a name="important"></a></h2><p>Thanks to the advancement of technology, we now live in a highly connected world. We are able to communicate with companies and organizations across the globe in a matter of seconds. However, while communication has never been more accessible, being able to understand the nuances and cultural differences of these communities is crucial.</p><p><b>Globalization</b> gives software developers the chance to access <b>hundreds of millions of potential new customers</b>. In order to do this successfully, though, they need to ensure they are offering every client the very best user experience.</p><p>There are many benefits to focusing on the software-localization-process, including:</p><h3 id="Maximizing-your-sales"><a href="#Maximizing-your-sales" class="headerlink" title="Maximizing your sales"></a>Maximizing your sales</h3><p>Localization gives you the chance to enjoy success on an international scale. When you are able to provide the end user with the very best experience, no matter where in the world they might be located, it will ensure you can quickly and easily enter new markets. Not only will this help to maximize your sales, but it can also help to strengthen your position in both the local and international market.</p><h3 id="Improving-user-experience"><a href="#Improving-user-experience" class="headerlink" title="Improving user experience"></a>Improving user experience</h3><p>High-quality localization can ensure everyone is able to enjoy the very best experience when using your products. Not only will they be able to clearly understand what you are saying, but they will get the most out of your software too. This improves the overall user experience, giving them a greater impression of your brand.</p><h3 id="Staying-ahead-of-your-competitors"><a href="#Staying-ahead-of-your-competitors" class="headerlink" title="Staying ahead of your competitors"></a>Staying ahead of your competitors</h3><p>In the fast-paced world that we live in, keeping your brand ahead of your competitors has never been more important. The software localization definition is about giving your customers the very best experience possible. That will allow you to stand out from the crowd, minimizing the risk of losing potential customers while also helping you to attract even more customers.</p><h3 id="Enhancing-feedback"><a href="#Enhancing-feedback" class="headerlink" title="Enhancing feedback"></a>Enhancing feedback</h3><p>Another significant benefit of the localization process, but one that is often overlooked, is that it can help you enjoy more feedback. When you have more users engaging with your software, it will help you to develop more in-depth feedback and generate more ideas for the future.</p><p><img src="project-managers.webp" alt="project managers" title="project managers"></p><h2 id="9-steps-to-successfully-implement-software-localization"><a href="#9-steps-to-successfully-implement-software-localization" class="headerlink" title="9 steps to successfully implement software localization "></a>9 steps to successfully implement software localization <a name="process"></a></h2><p>This guide will walk you through the essential steps to successfully implement software localization in your company. Whether you&#39;re a small startup or a large enterprise, embracing localization can help your software resonate with international users and drive business growth.</p><h3 id="1-Assessment-and-Planning"><a href="#1-Assessment-and-Planning" class="headerlink" title="1) Assessment and Planning"></a>1) Assessment and Planning</h3><p>Choose the languages and markets you want to target.Check to see if your software is localization-ready with these questions:</p><ul><li>Is your code dependable and bug-free?</li><li>Has your main language UI been put into place?</li><li>Is your text in main language complete?</li><li>Is your character encoding correct?</li></ul><h3 id="2-Translation"><a href="#2-Translation" class="headerlink" title="2) Translation"></a>2) Translation</h3><p>Choose professional translators or translation tools. Maintain context and accuracy during the translation process. A professional <a href="/blog/tms/">translation management system</a> has integrations with platforms offering translation services. A TMS supports increased project effectiveness, lower manual error rates, and guarantee timely delivery of localized software. </p><h3 id="3-Visual-Elements-Graphic-Design"><a href="#3-Visual-Elements-Graphic-Design" class="headerlink" title="3) Visual Elements / Graphic Design"></a>3) Visual Elements / Graphic Design</h3><p>Customize visual elements to align with local preferences. Respect cultural norms and sensitivities. It would help if you also considered implementing a style guide, covering things such as your branding, tone of voice, and formality. This will ensure a consistent and clear approach, no matter where in the world your users are accessing your software.</p><h3 id="4-Compliance-with-Legal-and-Regulatory-Requirements"><a href="#4-Compliance-with-Legal-and-Regulatory-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="4) Compliance with Legal and Regulatory Requirements"></a>4) Compliance with Legal and Regulatory Requirements</h3><p>Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations. Conduct a thorough analysis of legal and regulatory requirements that pertain to your software, including data privacy laws like <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" title="GDPR">GDPR</a>, accessibility standards such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines" title="WCAG">WCAG</a> , and industry-specific regulations.</p><h3 id="5-Testing"><a href="#5-Testing" class="headerlink" title="5) Testing"></a>5) Testing</h3><p>Thoroughly test the localized software for functionality and display. Identify and fix issues during the testing phase.</p><h3 id="6-Quality-Assurance-QA"><a href="#6-Quality-Assurance-QA" class="headerlink" title="6) Quality Assurance (QA)"></a>6) Quality Assurance (QA)</h3><p>Establish a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/quality-assurance" title="QA">QA</a>  process to ensure the quality of localized versions.

That means rather than seeing it as a task to complete in the final stages, you should incorporate it in every step of your software development. By adopting this approach, you can ensure that you are maximizing the user experience, and it can also help to speed up the delivery time.</p><h3 id="Use-a-localization-platform"><a href="#Use-a-localization-platform" class="headerlink" title="Use a localization platform"></a>Use a localization platform</h3><p>Effective software localization is a vast project, and utilizing a proven <a href="https://locize.com" title="localization management platform">localization management platform</a> can help to make the process easier. When choosing a platform, you should ensure that it has been developed specifically for localization. This will help to offer greater customization and allow you to integrate essential tools. For example <a href="/blog/react-i18next/" title="react localization">react localization</a> is made incredibly simple for developers when used in conjunction with the <a href="https://www.i18next.com/" title="i18next">i18next</a> framework.</p><p>You may use locize to make the process of the localization-projects of your company easier.

"></a>Who needs localization of software? <a name="who"></a></h2><p>The next decision is whether it is right for you. If your software targets a specific community or a selected region, localization might not be required.</p><p>However, if you are looking to expand into wider communities or give yourself the opportunity to do that at a later date, then it is something you should consider. Even if you are not considering an international move just yet, you should prepare as much as you can during the development stage.</p><p>The industry you work in should also be a major consideration. <b>Software localization should be a major consideration</b> for those working in the e-commerce, legal, or governmental sectors. Of course, it is not just limited to these sectors, so make sure you consider both your current and future requirements when deciding if you need <a href="/blog/l10n/" titel="l10n">l10n</a>.</p><p>In this technology-driven world, globalization means seeing an increasing number of organizations and companies working beyond their traditional localities. Software localization is crucial in helping you to successfully expand your business to other countries, allowing you to maximize your sales, boost your profits, and stand out from the crowd.</p><p>You definitely will need it when</p><ul><li>your business plan targets multiple regions or is region specific</li><li>you&#39;re developing your software code right now.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="title.jpg"></p><p>As technology continues to advance, the field of translation and localization is also seeing significant changes. In the coming years, we can expect to see a number of developments that will improve the accuracy and efficiency of language translation, making it easier for people and businesses to communicate across borders.</p><p>One of the most exciting developments in the field of translation is the use of neural machine translation (NMT), like <a href="../google-translate-accuracy/">Google Translate</a>. NMT is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that is able to learn the intricacies of a particular language and apply that knowledge to translations. This has led to a significant improvement in the quality of translations, particularly for less common languages.</p><p>Another area where we can expect to see advancements is in the use of natural language processing (NLP) to aid in localization. NLP is a field of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and human language. By using NLP techniques, like <a href="../google-translate-accuracy/#google-translate-competitors">ChatGPT</a>, software can be made to understand and respond to language in a more human-like way. This will make localization more accurate and efficient, as software will be able to understand the nuances and idioms of different languages and cultures.</p><p>With the increasing use of virtual and augmented reality technology, we can expect to see more demand for the translation of multimedia content. The ability to translate and localize video, audio and other multimedia content will become increasingly important as this technology becomes more prevalent. This also present new challenges and possibilities for localization, as translation engine will need to deal with idiomatic language, context, and tone.</p><p>We can also expect to see an increase in the use of crowdsourcing for translation and localization. By leveraging the power of the crowd, companies will be able to quickly and cost-effectively translate and localize their content into multiple languages. This has already <a href="https://docs.locize.com/guides-tips-and-tricks/working-with-translators#use-the-crowdbased-service-branched-projects">been used in some companies</a>, but will become more mainstream in the future as the approach improves and becomes more accessible.</p><p>In conclusion, the field of translation and localization is constantly evolving, and we can expect to see a number of exciting advancements in the coming years. The use of neural machine translation, natural language processing, and multimedia localization will improve the accuracy and efficiency of language translation. Additionally, the use of crowdsourcing will make it more cost-effective for businesses to communicate across borders. These developments will have far-reaching implications for industries such as e-commerce, education, entertainment, and many more, breaking down language barriers and making the world a more connected place.</p><script type="application/ld+json">  {    "@context": "https://schema.org",    "@type": "FAQPage",    "mainEntity": [{      "@type": "Question",      "name": "What is neural machine translation (NMT), and how is it changing the translation industry?",      "acceptedAnswer": {        "@type": "Answer",        "text": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses deep learning techniques to understand and translate text from one language to another.

If you&#39;re a TypeScript developer, you&#39;re likely acquainted with the advantages of static typing and the assurance it provides in your codebase. When it comes to internationalization (<a href="../what-is-i18n/">i18n</a>) and localization (<a href="../what-is-software-localization/">l10n</a>), maintaining the same level of type safety becomes crucial. This is precisely where <a href="https://www.i18next.com/">i18next</a>, an influential i18n framework, enters the picture.</p><p>In the past, i18next already furnished TypeScript definitions for its API, enabling developers to benefit from type checking while utilizing the library. However, a significant limitation persisted, specifically the absence of type safety for translation keys. Consequently, if a translation resource was missing or underwent a name change, the TypeScript compiler failed to detect it, resulting in potential errors during runtime.</p><p><img src="ts_api.jpg"></p><p>Nevertheless, with the advent of the new iterations of i18next, that limitation has been overcome <em>(thanks largely to <a href="https://github.com/pedrodurek">Pedro Durek</a>)</em>. Now, i18n keys boast complete type safety. Whenever a developer employs a non-existent or modified i18n key, the TypeScript compiler immediately raises an error, promptly alerting you to the issue before it gives rise to runtime complications. In addition, there is also an improved intellisense experience.</p><p>Within this guide, we will delve into the art of leveraging the latest version of i18next to attain translations that are impervious to type-related errors in your TypeScript applications. We will encompass everything from the fundamentals of i18next setup to advanced techniques. All the while, you will benefit from the added safety net of type checking for your translation keys.</p><p>By the conclusion of this guide, you will possess a profound comprehension of how to harness the force of i18next&#39;s type-safe translations within your TypeScript projects. You will be equipped to ensure that your translations are not only precise and adaptable but also consistently error-free, courtesy of the seamless integration between i18next and TypeScript. Let us embark on this journey together and furnish you with the knowledge and tools necessary to create localized applications that effortlessly cater to diverse language preferences while maintaining
