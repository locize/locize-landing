Let&#39;s examine the six main functions that a translation management platform should have:</p><ol><li>Managing translation workflows</li><li>Managing terminology</li><li>Use translation memory</li><li>Get the history and numbers</li><li>Auto machine translation</li><li>Integration API</li></ol><p><img src="translation-management-system.webp" alt="what is a translation management system"></p><h3 id="Managing-translation-workflows"><a href="#Managing-translation-workflows" class="headerlink" title="Managing translation workflows"></a>Managing translation workflows</h3><p>The TMS reduce the amount of manual effort performed during each of the steps.

Until one of the translation suggestions is accepted, the actual value won't change.</p></div><h3 id="Managing-terminology"><a href="#Managing-terminology" class="headerlink" title="Managing terminology"></a>Managing terminology</h3><p>Terminology is the fundamental cornerstone of all translations. To describe objects and form sentences, people use words, phrases, and jargon. </p><p>If your content generation has to be extended, certain criteria for managing material must be established for all parties involved. </p><p>You should keep track of terms that should or shouldn&#39;t be translated via a glossary. It exists to facilitate the use of the language that your business likes by human translators.</p><h3 id="Use-the-translation-memory"><a href="#Use-the-translation-memory" class="headerlink" title="Use the translation memory"></a>Use the translation memory</h3><p>A TMS&#39;s translation memory feature is especially crucial since it greatly boosts the productivity of language localization <a href="/blog/language-localization/" title="language localization">language localization</a>. </p><p>You can utilize words and phrases from previous work rather than coming up with new language every time. To assist human translators, sentences that have already been translated are stored in a database called a translation memory (TM).</p><h3 id="Get-the-history-and-numbers"><a href="#Get-the-history-and-numbers" class="headerlink" title="Get the history and numbers"></a>Get the history and numbers</h3><p>Every project management tool must provide the most crucial indicators about budget, progress, and other factors.</p><p>The majority of the tasks are contained in one program by the TMS. As a result, reporting the numbers is a must. The data insights from the TMS help improve the administration of your localization projects.</p><p>Additionally, keeping track of all previous translations might be helpful. In the event of an inconvenience, it is possible to demonstrate at any moment who made what changes and when.</p><p>Locize, our translation management system, offers an overview of the control center with the key figures for the ongoing project:</p><p>The control center of our <a href="/" title="localization software">localization software</a> displays all pertinent high-level data:</p><ul><li>user management</li><li>billing (customer details, billing history, budget limit, ...)</li><li>project settings (slack integration, webhook, integration metrics, ...)</li><li>ordering (services, pending orders)</li><li>branches</li><li>project health and metrics</li></ul><h3 id="Auto-Machine-Translation"><a href="#Auto-Machine-Translation" class="headerlink" title="Auto Machine Translation"></a>Auto Machine Translation</h3><p>With this capability, the TMS attempts to entirely automate the translation process. Traditionally, an application program interface (API) is used to connect translated texts to an engine that handles the translation automatically. </p><p>Because the results from artificial intelligence are typically not 100% fine, a translator is frequently needed to evaluate the auto translation output.</p><p>For locize, the entire automatic machine translation process occurs in the backend, which means you&#39;ll see the translated result after saving the new keys in reference language.</p><h4 id="Should-you-choose-machine-translation-a-translation-agency-or-a-freelancer"><a href="#Should-you-choose-machine-translation-a-translation-agency-or-a-freelancer" class="headerlink" title="Should you choose machine translation, a translation agency or a freelancer?"></a>Should you choose machine translation, a translation agency or a freelancer?</h4><p>These are three options when there is a need of translating content. Whether to engage a translation agency, a freelancer, or make use of machine translation. </p><p>Machine translation would be the most cost-effective approach because it is virtually free. However, if no one reviews the translated information, there will undoubtedly be a lack of transaltion quality.</p><p>Freelance translators are frequently enthusiastic about their work. They are frequently subject specialists who can execute sophisticated translations in their fields. This might be a wonderful alternative for those on a restricted budget. Working with a person rather than a firm is less expensive, and you don&#39;t have to sacrifice quality.</p><p>Translation agencies have greater resources to devote to your job than a freelancer. In addition, they offer a wide range of translation and localization services. They have extensive expertise in assisting you to overcome linguistic and cultural difficulties.</p><p>You will discover your ideal match for sure.</p><h3 id="Integration-API"><a href="#Integration-API" class="headerlink" title="Integration API"></a>Integration API</h3><p>API technology is used by excellent TMS to connect to and interact with cloud-based services. This enables it to automate and expand translation management in any content management system for all content kinds.</p><p>There is thorough documentation for locize on how to utilize an API to integrate any of your applications. The documentation may be found at <a href="https://docs.locize.com/integration/api">docs.locize.com/integration/api</a>.</p><h2 id="Benefits-of-using-a-TMS"><a href="#Benefits-of-using-a-TMS" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of using a TMS "></a>Benefits of using a TMS <a name="benefits"></a></h2><p>Manual transmission and receipt of translated texts is inefficient for bigger projects and may result in unstructured chaos and significant financial loss. If regular spreadsheets are inadequate for managing the volume of material, the TMS is for you.</p><p>Because a good TMS is </p><ul><li>Highly scalable</li><li>Easy to integrate</li><li>Easy to understand</li><li>Help with professional translation</li><li>Unleash localization progress</li><li>Notifies whenever something significant occurs</li></ul><p>In any event, if a company need expert translation for its own brand material, it makes sense to employ a TMS to make the translation process much easier. </p><p>On the surface, it appears to be a large investment, but upon closer inspection, the investment will pay for itself many times over as the process becomes much more efficient and dependable.</p><p>It&#39;s also how larger businesses do it; they have content management systems (CMS) as independent but linked applications or as simple add-ons that can meet particular multilingual requirements.</p><h2 id="How-translation-management-helped-businesses-in-achieving-success"><a href="#How-translation-management-helped-businesses-in-achieving-success" class="headerlink" title="How translation management helped businesses in achieving success "></a>How translation management helped businesses in achieving success <a name="businesses"></a></h2><p>Through the adoption of a Translation Management System (TMS), these enterprises harnessed enhanced productivity, cost-efficiency, and revenue growth, highlighting the TMS&#39;s transformative role in their success.</p><h3 id="30-more-projects-achieved-with-the-same-team"><a href="#30-more-projects-achieved-with-the-same-team" class="headerlink" title="30% more projects achieved with the same team"></a>30% more projects achieved with the same team</h3><p>Think of a company that does all of its translation work by hand. They automate project procedures after putting in place a TMS, which significantly shortens project turnaround times. Weeks-long tasks can now be finished in a matter of days. This increased productivity enables the business to reallocate important resources, which is especially important in a situation when there is a shortage of trained labor. For instance, Company A reports a 25% gain in revenue in addition to completing 30% more tasks per month after implementing a TMS.</p><h3 id="20-lower-expenses-to-reinvest-in-growing-the-company"><a href="#20-lower-expenses-to-reinvest-in-growing-the-company" class="headerlink" title="20% lower expenses to reinvest in growing the company"></a>20% lower expenses to reinvest in growing the company</h3><p>Without a TMS, project management can be labor-intensive and costly. By simplifying project administration and automating key tasks, a TMS minimizes administrative overhead. For example, Company B cut its project management costs by 20% after implementing a TMS, directly contributing to profit growth. These cost savings can be reinvested in business expansion, technology upgrades, or boosting the bottom line.</p><h3 id="25-increase-in-revenue-as-demand-rises"><a href="#25-increase-in-revenue-as-demand-rises" class="headerlink" title="25% increase in revenue as demand rises"></a>25% increase in revenue as demand rises</h3><p>Company C was looking to expand its client base and take on more translation projects. However, they were concerned about managing increased workloads effectively. By adopting a TMS with robust scalability, they could effortlessly accommodate the growing demand. The TMS allowed them to streamline workflows and maintain efficiency as their client base expanded. The result? A 25% growth in revenue within a year.</p><h3 id="40-more-recurring-business-with-higher-quality"><a href="#40-more-recurring-business-with-higher-quality" class="headerlink" title="40% more recurring business with higher quality"></a>40% more recurring business with higher quality</h3><p>Consistency and quality in translation are pivotal to client satisfaction. By storing translation memories and terminology databases, a TMS ensures consistent, high-quality translations. When clients receive accurate and reliable translations on every project, they become loyal customers. For instance, Company D witnessed a 40% increase in repeat business due to the improved quality of translations made possible by their TMS.</p><h3 id="20-of-revenue-boost-in-global-markets"><a href="#20-of-revenue-boost-in-global-markets" class="headerlink" title="20% of revenue boost in global markets"></a>20% of revenue boost in global markets</h3><p>Company E was focused on a domestic market. However, they wanted to tap into international markets. With a TMS, they were able to translate their content into multiple languages, opening doors to new global markets. They experienced a 20% revenue boost in the first year alone by entering untapped regions and reaching a wider audience.</p><p><img src="control-center.webp" alt="control center"></p><h2 id="What-to-consider-while-comparing-various-software-solutions"><a href="#What-to-consider-while-comparing-various-software-solutions" class="headerlink" title="What to consider while comparing various software solutions "></a>What to consider while comparing various software solutions <a name="compare"></a></h2><p>When you compare different translation management software, then ask the following questions regarding your business:</p><ul><li>Who will be impacted and how quickly (stakeholders, customers, employees)?</li><li>How will the TMS improve the end-user experience?</li><li>How much are we willing to spend on a TMS?</li><li>Which infrastructure will the developed material be hosted on?</li><li>Is it possible to automate any process?</li></ul><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YQryHo1iHb8" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><h2 id="Reasons-for-your-project-manager-or-developer-to-select-locize-as-your-TMS"><a href="#Reasons-for-your-project-manager-or-developer-to-select-locize-as-your-TMS" class="headerlink" title="Reasons for your project manager or developer to select locize as your TMS "></a>Reasons for your project manager or developer to select locize as your TMS <a name="locize"></a></h2><p>locize is an excellent product for several reasons: Simple interface for managing translations.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="title.jpg"></p><p>In the field of translation and localization, there is one tool that has been dominant for decades: SDL Trados. This software has been a staple for translators and language service providers (LSPs) alike, offering a suite of features that streamline translation workflows and improve overall productivity. However, as the translation industry evolves and new technologies emerge, some are questioning whether SDL Trados is still relevant in today&#39;s localization landscape. In this article, we&#39;ll explore this question and take a closer look at SDL Trados, its advantages and disadvantages, and why some are turning to more modern translation management systems.</p><h2 id="What-is-SDL-Trados"><a href="#What-is-SDL-Trados" class="headerlink" title="What is SDL Trados?"></a>What is SDL Trados?</h2><p>SDL Trados is a translation memory software developed by SDL, a company that specializes in language technology and services. The software is widely used by translators and LSPs to manage translation workflows and improve translation quality. SDL Trados offers a range of features, including translation memory, terminology management, and automated workflows, all designed to improve efficiency and productivity in the translation process.</p><h2 id="Advantages-of-SDL-Trados"><a href="#Advantages-of-SDL-Trados" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of SDL Trados"></a>Advantages of SDL Trados</h2><h3 id="Translation-memory"><a href="#Translation-memory" class="headerlink" title="Translation memory"></a>Translation memory</h3><p>One of the key advantages of SDL Trados is its translation memory (TM) functionality. Translation memory is a database that stores previously translated content, allowing translators to reuse translations for repeated phrases and sentences. This can greatly reduce translation time and costs while improving consistency across translations.</p><h3 id="Terminology-management"><a href="#Terminology-management" class="headerlink" title="Terminology management"></a>Terminology management</h3><p>Another advantage of SDL Trados is its terminology management feature. This allows users to create and manage glossaries of key terms specific to their industry or project, ensuring consistency and accuracy across translations.</p><h3 id="Automated-workflows"><a href="#Automated-workflows" class="headerlink" title="Automated workflows"></a>Automated workflows</h3><p>SDL Trados also offers automated workflows, which can save significant time and effort in the translation process. For example, the software can automatically detect file formats, segment content, and suggest translations based on the translation memory and terminology database. This can speed up the translation process and reduce the risk of errors.</p><h2 id="Disadvantages-of-SDL-Trados"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-SDL-Trados" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of SDL Trados"></a>Disadvantages of SDL Trados</h2><h3 id="Expensive-licensing-fees"><a href="#Expensive-licensing-fees" class="headerlink" title="Expensive licensing fees"></a>Expensive licensing fees</h3><p>One of the main disadvantages of SDL Trados is its licensing fees. The software can be very expensive, especially for freelancers or small businesses. The licensing structure can also be complex, making it difficult for users to choose the right package for their needs.</p><h3 id="Complex-interface"><a href="#Complex-interface" class="headerlink" title="Complex interface"></a>Complex interface</h3><p>SDL Trados can also be complex to use, especially for new users. The interface can be overwhelming, and it may take some time to learn how to use all of the features effectively.</p><h3 id="Not-cloud-based"><a href="#Not-cloud-based" class="headerlink" title="Not cloud-based"></a>Not cloud-based</h3><p>Finally, SDL Trados is not cloud-based, meaning that users must install the software on their local machines. This can limit collaboration and accessibility, especially for teams working remotely.</p><h2 id="Alternatives-to-SDL-Trados"><a href="#Alternatives-to-SDL-Trados" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to SDL Trados"></a>Alternatives to SDL Trados</h2><p>As the translation industry evolves, new technologies are emerging that offer alternatives to SDL Trados. One of the most popular alternatives is cloud-based translation management systems, which offer greater collaboration and accessibility. One such system is <a href="/">locize</a>, which offers a range of features similar to SDL Trados but is entirely cloud-based.</p><h3 id="Cloud-based-solutions"><a href="#Cloud-based-solutions" class="headerlink" title="Cloud-based solutions"></a>Cloud-based solutions</h3><p>Cloud-based translation management systems, such as <a href="/">locize</a>, offer several advantages over traditional software like SDL Trados. For one, they can be accessed from anywhere, making them ideal for remote teams or teams working across different locations. They also offer greater collaboration features, such as real-time translation memory updates and more streamlined communication among team members. Another special advantage of <a href="/">locize</a> is the way it can be directly integrated to your software or website, this way translators can modify translations <a href="https://youtu.be/YQryHo1iHb8">without the need</a> to ask the developers to adapt their code or to redeploy their software or website. In addition, cloud-based systems often have lower upfront costs and are more scalable, allowing companies to pay only for what they need as they grow.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>While SDL Trados has been a dominant force in the translation industry for many years, it may no longer be the best fit for all companies. As the industry evolves, it is important to consider newer, cloud-based alternatives like <a href="/">locize</a> that offer greater collaboration, accessibility, and scalability. Ultimately, the best translation management system will depend on the specific needs of your company, so it is important to carefully evaluate the options before making a decision.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="title.jpg"></p><p><a href="../what-is-i18n/">i18n</a>, or internationalization, is a critical aspect of software development that allows applications to adapt to different languages and cultural norms. However, despite its importance, there are still a number of misconceptions about i18n that persist in the tech community. In this article, we will take a humorous and satirical look at some of the most common myths and misconceptions about i18n. So put on your sarcastic hats and let&#39;s dive into the world of i18n!</p><h2 id="Myth-1-i18n-Is-Only-Important-for-Multinational-Companies"><a href="#Myth-1-i18n-Is-Only-Important-for-Multinational-Companies" class="headerlink" title="Myth 1: i18n Is Only Important for Multinational Companies"></a>Myth 1: i18n Is Only Important for Multinational Companies</h2><p>Many people believe that i18n is only relevant to large multinational corporations with customers around the world. This couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. In today&#39;s globalized world, even small businesses can benefit from i18n. By making your application available in multiple languages, you can expand your customer base and <a href="../grow-online-business/">increase your revenue</a>. Who wouldn&#39;t want that?</p><h2 id="Myth-2-i18n-Is-Just-Translation"><a href="#Myth-2-i18n-Is-Just-Translation" class="headerlink" title="Myth 2: i18n Is Just Translation"></a>Myth 2: i18n Is Just Translation</h2><p>Another common misconception about i18n is that it&#39;s just about translating text from one language to another. In fact, i18n is much more than that. It involves adapting user interfaces, date and time formats, and even cultural norms such as currency symbols and units of measurement. So if you thought i18n was just about running text through <a href="../google-translate-accuracy/">Google Translate</a>, think again!</p><h2 id="Myth-3-i18n-Is-Too-Expensive-and-Time-Consuming"><a href="#Myth-3-i18n-Is-Too-Expensive-and-Time-Consuming" class="headerlink" title="Myth 3: i18n Is Too Expensive and Time-Consuming"></a>Myth 3: i18n Is Too Expensive and Time-Consuming</h2><p>Some developers believe that implementing i18n in their application is too expensive and time-consuming. Sure, it may take some extra effort up front, but the benefits far outweigh the costs. By making your application available to users around the world, you can reach new markets and increase your profits. And with <a href="../i18n-l10n-t9n-tms/">translation management software</a> tools, like <a href="">locize</a>, implementing i18n has never been easier or more affordable.</p><h2 id="Myth-4-i18n-Is-Only-Relevant-to-Certain-Industries"><a href="#Myth-4-i18n-Is-Only-Relevant-to-Certain-Industries" class="headerlink" title="Myth 4: i18n Is Only Relevant to Certain Industries"></a>Myth 4: i18n Is Only Relevant to Certain Industries</h2><p>Some people believe that i18n is only relevant to certain industries, such as e-commerce or travel. This could not be further from the truth. Virtually any type of application can benefit from i18n, from social media platforms to video games. After all, everyone deserves to be able to use an application in their own language and according to their own cultural norms. <a href="../is-your-software-ready-for-localization/">Play the game</a> and try to make your application ready for localization!</p><h2 id="Myth-5-i18n-Is-Only-Relevant-to-Non-English-Languages"><a href="#Myth-5-i18n-Is-Only-Relevant-to-Non-English-Languages" class="headerlink" title="Myth 5: i18n Is Only Relevant to Non-English Languages"></a>Myth 5: i18n Is Only Relevant to Non-English Languages</h2><p>Finally, some people believe that i18n is only relevant to non-English languages. In fact, i18n is just as important for English-language applications. After all, English is not the <a href="../grow-online-business/">native language of everyone</a> who uses it. And different English-speaking countries have their own cultural norms and inguistic quirks. By implementing i18n, you can ensure that your application is accessible to all English-speaking users, regardless of where they&#39;re from.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In summary, i18n is a critical aspect of <a href="../what-is-software-localization/">software development</a> that is often misunderstood. By debunking these common misconceptions, we hope to help more developers realize the importance of i18n and incorporate it into their applications. So the next time someone tries to tell you that i18n is just translation or too expensive, you can set them straight. And who knows, maybe one day we&#39;ll all be speaking the same language... or not.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Say Hello to CAT (Computer-Assisted Translation): The Personal Translator in Your Pocket</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="title.jpg"></p><p>Welcome to the world of CATs, or Computer-Assisted Translation Software! These handy little programs are like having a personal translator in your pocket (or on your computer, whichever you prefer).</p><p>But what exactly is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_translation">CAT</a>, you ask? Well, it&#39;s pretty much exactly what it sounds like. It&#39;s software that helps you translate text from one language to another. Think of it like having a bilingual friend who you can text whenever you come across a word or phrase you don&#39;t understand.</p><p>Now, I know what you might be thinking: &quot;But wait, don&#39;t we already have <a href="../google-translate-accuracy/">Google Translate</a>?&quot; And yes, you&#39;re right! Google Translate is a great tool for quick and easy translations. But CATs are a bit different. They&#39;re specifically designed for professional translators and are much more powerful than your average online translator.</p><p>One of the most important features of CATs is their ability to &quot;remember&quot; translations. So, if you&#39;re working on a big project and you keep coming across the <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/glossary">same phrase</a> over and over again, the CAT will remember how you translated it the first time and will automatically use the same translation for all future instances. This can save you a lot of time and make your translations much more consistent.</p><p>Another great feature of CATs is their ability to work with &quot;<a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/translation-memory">translation memories</a>&quot;. These are databases of previously translated text, which can be used to help speed up the translation process and ensure consistency. So, if you&#39;re translating a document and you come across a sentence that&#39;s already been translated before, the CAT will pull up the previous translation and suggest it to you. Pretty cool, right?</p><p>So, to sum it up, CATs are like having your own personal translator who never forgets anything and can access a vast library of translations. If you&#39;re a professional translator, they&#39;re an absolute must-have tool. And if you&#39;re not, they can still be a handy tool to have around for those times when you need to translate something quickly and easily.</p><p>Also locize has a CAT.<br />For example the <a href="https://docs.locize.com/different-views/global">global view</a>:<img src="global.webp"><br />Or the <a href="https://docs.locize.com/different-views/focus">focus view</a>:<img src="focus.webp"><br />But there&#39;s also an <a href="https://docs.locize.com/different-views/incontext">in-context view</a>:<img src="incontext.webp"></p><p>In conclusion, CATs are the perfect tool for professional translators and anyone who needs a helping hand with translations! So, don&#39;t be shy, give them a try!</p>]]></content>

As stated in the introduction, i18n is a shorthand for internationalization and is commonly used in the software industry. </p><p>As a result of going global, companies&#39; product design and development suffer.</p><p>You plan to enter foreign markets with your company, there is a huge demand for localizing an application, website content, or any document related. During this business transformation, the managers of those businesses must consider the new culture, region, and language.</p><p>We live in an undeniably digital world, and things are only going to get faster. As a result, the software industry has developed it&#39;s own business model, with providers assisting with various digital services while entering new markets. </p><p>These services are also known as <a href="/" title="localization-service">localization-service</a>. Finally, the terms internationalization and internationalizing-software are frequently used interchangeably, so we can answer <b>&quot;what is i18n&quot;</b> with an industry-term for businesses going international.</p><p><img src="international-business.jpg" alt="international business"></p><h3 id="It-is-not-always-given-the-attention-it-deserves"><a href="#It-is-not-always-given-the-attention-it-deserves" class="headerlink" title="It is not always given the attention it deserves "></a>It is not always given the attention it deserves <a name="industry"></a></h3><p>In our opinion, the process of managing software to support local circumstances is in growing companies still a manual procedure. In this stage the company is in, a professional way is appreciated for the clients. Here are some interesting <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_5481" title="facts about internet surfers in Europe">facts about internet surfers in Europe</a> that showing how important localization is:</p><ul><li>Only a fraction of enterprises uses advanced digital technologies</li><li>56% of individuals in the EU have at least basic digital skills</li></ul><p>This demonstrates that only a few businesses are utilizing technology as they should today. According to the article, many more people will develop digital skills over the next decade.</p><p>If you are a growing international business, i18n can assist you in meeting the needs of internet users. In the same vein, you will be able to improve the quality of your products or services by utilizing advanced digital technologies.</p><p>Finally, according to <a href="https://www.bea.gov/data/intl-trade-investment/international-services-expanded" title="data">data</a> from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, US businesses are increasingly providing services to foreigners. For the past few years, there has been a more than 15% increase.</p><p>These figures show that every company must be aware of the internationalization of its operations, particularly its software. The software can be viewed as the primary means of achieving digital transformation. This leads us to the next subject on which you should brush up on your internationalization knowledge:</p><h3 id="The-different-steps-during-internationalization"><a href="#The-different-steps-during-internationalization" class="headerlink" title="The different steps during internationalization  "></a>The different steps during internationalization  <a name="fields"></a></h3><p>This can be used as step-by-step procedure:</p><ul><li>Build your team</li><li>Evaluate the right translation management software</li><li>Preparing your software (date, time, strings, languages, etc.)</li><li>Take care of compliance</li><li>Optimize marketing in app store and search engines</li><li>Test your localization</li><li>Learn and amend your solution</li></ul><p>An i18n-framework can be used for the preparation of your software during the process.

We take a closer look at what this means and how it can help you. </p><div style="border-left: 0.5px solid orange;padding: 0.5rem 2rem"><h2 style="color:orange;">What is localization</h2><p style="color:grey;">Localization involves adapting a product or service to align with the language, culture, or preferences of a specific audience. A successful localization effort results in a product or service that seamlessly integrates with the local culture, giving the impression that it was originally created for that specific market.</p></div><p>For international brands and organizations, it is essential in helping to give their customers the very best experience possible. An effective localization-process can transform a business, helping to increase reach and maximize engagements, but what exactly is it?</p><p>Let&#39;s get started.</p><h2 id="Table-of-contents"><a href="#Table-of-contents" class="headerlink" title="Table of contents"></a>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#concept">What is the concept of localization</a></li><li><a href="#examples">Real-life examples of successful localization-efforts</a></li><li><a href="#examples">Information on localization-strategies</a></li><li><a href="#goal">What are the goals of localization</a></li><li><a href="#resources">Resources related to the importance of localization in international markets</a></li><li><a href="#guides">Guides on how to implement localization</a></li><li><a href="#thoughts">Final thoughts</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-does-localization-mean"><a href="#What-does-localization-mean" class="headerlink" title="What does localization mean "></a>What does localization mean <a name="concept"></a></h2><p>So while language translation is the process of converting written content from one language into another, localization goes beyond this. It will look at things such as:</p><h3 id="Language"><a href="#Language" class="headerlink" title="Language"></a>Language</h3><p>Translating text and ensuring it&#39;s culturally appropriate, considering idiomatic expressions, slang, and terminology specific to the target language.</p><h3 id="Content-Adaptation"><a href="#Content-Adaptation" class="headerlink" title="Content Adaptation"></a>Content Adaptation</h3><p>Adapting content to align with the cultural norms, beliefs, and values of the target audience. This includes imagery, symbols, colors, and references that might be sensitive or offensive in a particular culture.</p><h3 id="Regional-Preferences"><a href="#Regional-Preferences" class="headerlink" title="Regional Preferences"></a>Regional Preferences</h3><p>Customizing the product or content to cater to regional preferences, such as date formats, currencies, units of measurement, and other regional differences.</p><h3 id="User-Interface-UI"><a href="#User-Interface-UI" class="headerlink" title="User Interface (UI)"></a>User Interface (UI)</h3><p>Adjusting the user interface, layout, and design to accommodate different languages and reading directions (e.g., right-to-left for Arabic or Hebrew).</p><h3 id="Legal-and-Regulatory-Compliance"><a href="#Legal-and-Regulatory-Compliance" class="headerlink" title="Legal and Regulatory Compliance"></a>Legal and Regulatory Compliance</h3><p>Ensuring that the product or content complies with local laws, regulations, and industry standards.</p><h3 id="Functionality"><a href="#Functionality" class="headerlink" title="Functionality"></a>Functionality</h3><p>Modifying features or functionality that may not be relevant or practical in the target market or adding features that are specific to that market.</p><h3 id="Testing"><a href="#Testing" class="headerlink" title="Testing"></a>Testing</h3><p>Rigorously testing the localized product or content to identify and resolve issues related to linguistic, cultural, or technical aspects.</p><p>Localization is a crucial strategy for businesses of all sizes because it makes their content more appealing to the audience they are trying to reach. The process of first enabling a product to be localized, then localizing it for various national audiences is sometimes know as <a href="/blog/globalization-vs-localization/" title="globalization">globalization</a>.</p><p>According to <a href="https://insights.csa-research.com/reportaction/305013126/Marketing">this article</a> 40% of consumers have said that they will never purchase from a website that wasn’t in their native language.

The global streaming giant has become synonymous with efforts on both the translation side of things and on the developer side. The technology and processes that they utilize are translated and localized in every region, meaning the interface and apps change, as do the subtitles and voice dubbing of content. Even the films and TV shows they develop are localized for specific countries.</p>    <span style="font-size:0.7rem">Source: <a href="https://www.netflix.com/" title="netflix">netflix</a></span>  </div></div><div style="border-left: 0.5px solid orange;padding: 0.5rem 2rem"><p style="color:grey;">Check out our more real-life examples <a href="/customers.html" title="Customer Success Stories">on this page</a>.</p></div><h2 id="What-are-the-goals-of-localization"><a href="#What-are-the-goals-of-localization" class="headerlink" title="What are the goals of localization "></a>What are the goals of localization <a name="goal"></a></h2><p>The ultimate goal is to develop a clear user experience that helps to drive your marketing and support you in achieving your goals. However, there are many benefits that can come from implementing it, including:</p><h4 id="Enter-new-markets"><a href="#Enter-new-markets" class="headerlink" title="Enter new markets"></a>Enter new markets</h4><p>One of the main goals of a <a href="/blog/localization-strategy" title="localization-strategy">localization-strategy</a> is to help brands to easily enter new markets. It will help overcome any logistical or legal hurdles, ensuring smooth communication across every partner. </p><h4 id="Secure-a-competitive-edge"><a href="#Secure-a-competitive-edge" class="headerlink" title="Secure a competitive edge"></a>Secure a competitive edge</h4><p>Implementing localization can also help companies to develop a competitive edge. Going against competitors in a local market can be incredibly challenging as they often have the trust of local audiences. It will help you to build that trust, giving you the edge. </p><h4 id="Improve-customer-satisfaction"><a href="#Improve-customer-satisfaction" class="headerlink" title="Improve customer satisfaction"></a>Improve customer satisfaction</h4><p>Another important goal is that it helps to improve customer satisfaction. When they are seeing content in their own language and in a style they are more comfortable with; they are more likely to buy or use your products and services. </p><h4 id="Increase-brand-loyalty"><a href="#Increase-brand-loyalty" class="headerlink" title="Increase brand loyalty"></a>Increase brand loyalty</h4><p>When you are able to improve customer satisfaction, you will also increase brand loyalty.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="software-localization.webp" alt="software localization" title="Software Localization"></p><p>According to a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/software-localization-market-reach-15-140100165.html" title="recent study">recent study</a>, the global market for software localization generated $5.9 billion in revenue in 2022 and is predicted to grow even more until 2032, when it is predicted to reach $15.6 billion.</p><p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic, as businesses shifted operations online and broadened their global reach as a result of increased business focus on global expansion, this topic has become even more important.</p><p>Software localization can be an expensive process, especially for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) with tight budgets, and it takes time and resources to ensure high-quality results in localization projects. </p><p>What is it about and what benefits can it offer your business?</p><p>If you are faced with this issue, you can get started with these details. </p><p>Let&#39;s go!</p><h2 id="Table-of-contents"><a href="#Table-of-contents" class="headerlink" title="Table of contents"></a>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#what">What is software localization?</a></li><li><a href="#undertaken">How does localization take place?</a></li><li><a href="#important">Why localization of software is important</a></li><li><a href="#process">Successful implementation</a></li><li><a href="#who">Who needs localization of software?</a></li><li><a href="#nextlevel">Test our solution for free</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-is-software-localization"><a href="#What-is-software-localization" class="headerlink" title="What is software localization? "></a>What is software localization? <a name="what"></a></h2><p>Software localization helps to adapt software to the language and circumstances of the target market while retaining its originality. This means that not only is the text being adapted into the relevant language, but the design and overall user experience (UX) are amended to ensure that it meets the needs of the target audience.</p><p>While <a href="../what-is-i18n/">internationalization (i18n)</a> is about developing a product to meet the demands of a specific culture or audience, localization of software is a far more in-depth solution. The process usually requires the complete modification of text and multimedia for a software product. </p><p>For example, trying to localize a piece of software that is in English into Chinese is not simply a case of translating the wording. The length of text and symbols are entirely different, meaning the whole visual layout will need to be amended to ensure the overall user experience (UX) remains the same.</p><p>Software localization goes much further than that, too. It also looks at the resources and links being used, the time- and date-format, the use of images or gestures to ensure they are culturally appropriate, and even the direction the text needs to be read in.</p><p>This makes the whole process incredibly complex and time-consuming process, but it is a worthwhile investment for any developer.</p><h2 id="How-does-localization-take-place"><a href="#How-does-localization-take-place" class="headerlink" title="How does localization take place? "></a>How does localization take place? <a name="undertaken"></a></h2><p>Software can be localised in two core areas, internationsalisation and then localization. The <b>internationalization</b> process <b>covers the design and development</b>, which means you should:</p><ul><li>review your application framework to ensure it can support your requirements</li><li>thoroughly plan your content, including understanding how much space translated text will require. </li><li>incorporate the needs regarding content into the design, helping to make the localization more effective.</li><li>code your strings to allow you to expand when required.</li><li>externalize any strings that have been prepped for localization</li></ul><p>Once you have successfully completed the internationalization phase, you should then begin to incorporate the <b>localization</b> phase. This is <b>the process of translating your content utilizing a skilled translator</b> and ensuring they are covering every part of your software.</p><p>The translation is one of the most important parts of your localization, so once complete, you must thoroughly review everything. This includes checking the accuracy of the content, the quality of the language, and the terminology being used.</p><p>Once finished, you will then need to copy the translations into your software and begin testing it in every locality you are targeting. When you are certain that the software is working as designed and free from bugs, it can then be released to the public.</p><h3 id="Waterfall-vs-continuous-localization-What’s-the-difference"><a href="#Waterfall-vs-continuous-localization-What’s-the-difference" class="headerlink" title="Waterfall vs continuous localization: What’s the difference?"></a>Waterfall vs continuous localization: What’s the difference?</h3><p>For localization of software there are different workflows. The most traditional is to break down the activities into linear sequential phases - the so called waterfall workflow, where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to a specialization of tasks.</p><p><img src="waterfall-workflow.webp" alt="waterfall workflow" title="waterfall workflow"></p><p><a href="/blog/modern-continuous-localization/">Continuous software localization</a> combines software development and localization into one process so that software developers work in parallel with the localization team from the very beginning:</p><p><img src="continous-workflow.webp" alt="continous workflow" title="continous workflow"></p><h2 id="Why-localization-of-software-is-important"><a href="#Why-localization-of-software-is-important" class="headerlink" title="Why localization of software is important? "></a>Why localization of software is important? <a name="important"></a></h2><p>Thanks to the advancement of technology, we now live in a highly connected world. We are able to communicate with companies and organizations across the globe in a matter of seconds. However, while communication has never been more accessible, being able to understand the nuances and cultural differences of these communities is crucial.</p><p><b>Globalization</b> gives software developers the chance to access <b>hundreds of millions of potential new customers</b>. In order to do this successfully, though, they need to ensure they are offering every client the very best user experience.</p><p>There are many benefits to focusing on the software-localization-process, including:</p><h3 id="Maximizing-your-sales"><a href="#Maximizing-your-sales" class="headerlink" title="Maximizing your sales"></a>Maximizing your sales</h3><p>Localization gives you the chance to enjoy success on an international scale. When you are able to provide the end user with the very best experience, no matter where in the world they might be located, it will ensure you can quickly and easily enter new markets. Not only will this help to maximize your sales, but it can also help to strengthen your position in both the local and international market.</p><h3 id="Improving-user-experience"><a href="#Improving-user-experience" class="headerlink" title="Improving user experience"></a>Improving user experience</h3><p>High-quality localization can ensure everyone is able to enjoy the very best experience when using your products. Not only will they be able to clearly understand what you are saying, but they will get the most out of your software too. This improves the overall user experience, giving them a greater impression of your brand.</p><h3 id="Staying-ahead-of-your-competitors"><a href="#Staying-ahead-of-your-competitors" class="headerlink" title="Staying ahead of your competitors"></a>Staying ahead of your competitors</h3><p>In the fast-paced world that we live in, keeping your brand ahead of your competitors has never been more important. The software localization definition is about giving your customers the very best experience possible. That will allow you to stand out from the crowd, minimizing the risk of losing potential customers while also helping you to attract even more customers.</p><h3 id="Enhancing-feedback"><a href="#Enhancing-feedback" class="headerlink" title="Enhancing feedback"></a>Enhancing feedback</h3><p>Another significant benefit of the localization process, but one that is often overlooked, is that it can help you enjoy more feedback. When you have more users engaging with your software, it will help you to develop more in-depth feedback and generate more ideas for the future.</p><p><img src="project-managers.webp" alt="project managers" title="project managers"></p><h2 id="9-steps-to-successfully-implement-software-localization"><a href="#9-steps-to-successfully-implement-software-localization" class="headerlink" title="9 steps to successfully implement software localization "></a>9 steps to successfully implement software localization <a name="process"></a></h2><p>This guide will walk you through the essential steps to successfully implement software localization in your company. Whether you&#39;re a small startup or a large enterprise, embracing localization can help your software resonate with international users and drive business growth.</p><h3 id="1-Assessment-and-Planning"><a href="#1-Assessment-and-Planning" class="headerlink" title="1) Assessment and Planning"></a>1) Assessment and Planning</h3><p>Choose the languages and markets you want to target.Check to see if your software is localization-ready with these questions:</p><ul><li>Is your code dependable and bug-free?</li><li>Has your main language UI been put into place?</li><li>Is your text in main language complete?</li><li>Is your character encoding correct?</li></ul><h3 id="2-Translation"><a href="#2-Translation" class="headerlink" title="2) Translation"></a>2) Translation</h3><p>Choose professional translators or translation tools. Maintain context and accuracy during the translation process. A professional <a href="/blog/tms/">translation management system</a> has integrations with platforms offering translation services. A TMS supports increased project effectiveness, lower manual error rates, and guarantee timely delivery of localized software. </p><h3 id="3-Visual-Elements-Graphic-Design"><a href="#3-Visual-Elements-Graphic-Design" class="headerlink" title="3) Visual Elements / Graphic Design"></a>3) Visual Elements / Graphic Design</h3><p>Customize visual elements to align with local preferences. Respect cultural norms and sensitivities. It would help if you also considered implementing a style guide, covering things such as your branding, tone of voice, and formality. This will ensure a consistent and clear approach, no matter where in the world your users are accessing your software.</p><h3 id="4-Compliance-with-Legal-and-Regulatory-Requirements"><a href="#4-Compliance-with-Legal-and-Regulatory-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="4) Compliance with Legal and Regulatory Requirements"></a>4) Compliance with Legal and Regulatory Requirements</h3><p>Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations. Conduct a thorough analysis of legal and regulatory requirements that pertain to your software, including data privacy laws like <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" title="GDPR">GDPR</a>, accessibility standards such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines" title="WCAG">WCAG</a> , and industry-specific regulations.</p><h3 id="5-Testing"><a href="#5-Testing" class="headerlink" title="5) Testing"></a>5) Testing</h3><p>Thoroughly test the localized software for functionality and display.

That means rather than seeing it as a task to complete in the final stages, you should incorporate it in every step of your software development. By adopting this approach, you can ensure that you are maximizing the user experience, and it can also help to speed up the delivery time.</p><h3 id="Use-a-localization-platform"><a href="#Use-a-localization-platform" class="headerlink" title="Use a localization platform"></a>Use a localization platform</h3><p>Effective software localization is a vast project, and utilizing a proven <a href="https://locize.com" title="localization management platform">localization management platform</a> can help to make the process easier. When choosing a platform, you should ensure that it has been developed specifically for localization. This will help to offer greater customization and allow you to integrate essential tools.

"></a>Who needs localization of software? <a name="who"></a></h2><p>The next decision is whether it is right for you. If your software targets a specific community or a selected region, localization might not be required.</p><p>However, if you are looking to expand into wider communities or give yourself the opportunity to do that at a later date, then it is something you should consider. Even if you are not considering an international move just yet, you should prepare as much as you can during the development stage.</p><p>The industry you work in should also be a major consideration. <b>Software localization should be a major consideration</b> for those working in the e-commerce, legal, or governmental sectors.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="title.jpg"></p><p>As technology continues to advance, the field of translation and localization is also seeing significant changes. In the coming years, we can expect to see a number of developments that will improve the accuracy and efficiency of language translation, making it easier for people and businesses to communicate across borders.</p><p>One of the most exciting developments in the field of translation is the use of neural machine translation (NMT), like <a href="../google-translate-accuracy/">Google Translate</a>. NMT is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that is able to learn the intricacies of a particular language and apply that knowledge to translations. This has led to a significant improvement in the quality of translations, particularly for less common languages.</p><p>Another area where we can expect to see advancements is in the use of natural language processing (NLP) to aid in localization. NLP is a field of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and human language. By using NLP techniques, like <a href="../google-translate-accuracy/#google-translate-competitors">ChatGPT</a>, software can be made to understand and respond to language in a more human-like way. This will make localization more accurate and efficient, as software will be able to understand the nuances and idioms of different languages and cultures.</p><p>With the increasing use of virtual and augmented reality technology, we can expect to see more demand for the translation of multimedia content. The ability to translate and localize video, audio and other multimedia content will become increasingly important as this technology becomes more prevalent. This also present new challenges and possibilities for localization, as translation engine will need to deal with idiomatic language, context, and tone.</p><p>We can also expect to see an increase in the use of crowdsourcing for translation and localization. By leveraging the power of the crowd, companies will be able to quickly and cost-effectively translate and localize their content into multiple languages. This has already <a href="https://docs.locize.com/guides-tips-and-tricks/working-with-translators#use-the-crowdbased-service-branched-projects">been used in some companies</a>, but will become more mainstream in the future as the approach improves and becomes more accessible.</p><p>In conclusion, the field of translation and localization is constantly evolving, and we can expect to see a number of exciting advancements in the coming years. The use of neural machine translation, natural language processing, and multimedia localization will improve the accuracy and efficiency of language translation. Additionally, the use of crowdsourcing will make it more cost-effective for businesses to communicate across borders. These developments will have far-reaching implications for industries such as e-commerce, education, entertainment, and many more, breaking down language barriers and making the world a more connected place.</p><script type="application/ld+json">  {    "@context": "https://schema.org",    "@type": "FAQPage",    "mainEntity": [{      "@type": "Question",      "name": "What is neural machine translation (NMT), and how is it changing the translation industry?",      "acceptedAnswer": {        "@type": "Answer",        "text": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses deep learning techniques to understand and translate text from one language to another.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="title.jpg" alt="TypeScript Localization made easy with this step-by-step guide using i18next ✅" title="TypeScript Localization example"></p><p>As our world becomes increasingly interconnected, the development of web applications that cater to a <a href="../grow-online-business/">global audience</a> takes precedence among developers. If you&#39;re a TypeScript developer, you&#39;re likely acquainted with the advantages of static typing and the assurance it provides in your codebase. When it comes to internationalization (<a href="../what-is-i18n/">i18n</a>) and localization (<a href="../what-is-software-localization/">l10n</a>), maintaining the same level of type safety becomes crucial. This is precisely where <a href="https://www.i18next.com/">i18next</a>, an influential i18n framework, enters the picture.</p><p>In the past, i18next already furnished TypeScript definitions for its API, enabling developers to benefit from type checking while utilizing the library. However, a significant limitation persisted, specifically the absence of type safety for translation keys. Consequently, if a translation resource was missing or underwent a name change, the TypeScript compiler failed to detect it, resulting in potential errors during runtime.</p><p><img src="ts_api.jpg"></p><p>Nevertheless, with the advent of the new iterations of i18next, that limitation has been overcome <em>(thanks largely to <a href="https://github.com/pedrodurek">Pedro Durek</a>)</em>. Now, i18n keys boast complete type safety. Whenever a developer employs a non-existent or modified i18n key, the TypeScript compiler immediately raises an error, promptly alerting you to the issue before it gives rise to runtime complications. In addition, there is also an improved intellisense experience.</p><p>Within this guide, we will delve into the art of leveraging the latest version of i18next to attain translations that are impervious to type-related errors in your TypeScript applications. We will encompass everything from the fundamentals of i18next setup to advanced techniques. All the while, you will benefit from the added safety net of type checking for your translation keys.</p><p>By the conclusion of this guide, you will possess a profound comprehension of how to harness the force of i18next&#39;s type-safe translations within your TypeScript projects. You will be equipped to ensure that your translations are not only precise and adaptable but also consistently error-free, courtesy of the seamless integration between i18next and TypeScript. Let us embark on this journey together and furnish you with the knowledge and tools necessary to create localized applications that effortlessly cater to diverse language preferences while maintaining the robustness of your codebase.</p><h2 id="In-Memory-translations"><a href="#In-Memory-translations" class="headerlink" title="In-Memory translations "></a>In-Memory translations <a

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="title.jpg"></p><p>In today&#39;s globalized world, creating multilingual applications is crucial to reaching a wider audience. One of the key components of successful application localization is accurate translation. However, it&#39;s not uncommon to encounter missing translations when using <a href="https://www.i18next.com/">i18next</a>, a popular internationalization framework. These missing translations can lead to a confusing user experience and undermine the efforts put into localization. In this article, we will explore various strategies and techniques to gracefully handle missing translations in <a href="https://www.i18next.com/">i18next</a>, enabling you to provide a polished and seamless multilingual application.</p><h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Before diving into the details, let&#39;s first understand the significance of i18next and the challenges posed by missing translations. i18next is a powerful JavaScript library that simplifies the process of internationalizing web applications. It allows developers to easily manage translations for different languages by usually organizing them in language files and using unique translation keys. This approach ensures that the application&#39;s content can be dynamically translated based on the user&#39;s preferred language.</p><p>However, when translations are missing for specific keys or languages, it can disrupt the localization workflow. Users may encounter untranslated content, placeholders, or even errors, leading to a poor user experience. To avoid such situations, it is essential to have effective strategies in place to handle missing translations and maintain a high level of quality in your multilingual application.</p><h2 id="Understanding-i18next-Translation"><a href="#Understanding-i18next-Translation" class="headerlink" title="Understanding i18next Translation"></a>Understanding i18next Translation</h2><p>To effectively address missing translations, it&#39;s important to have a clear understanding of how i18next translation works. In i18next, translations are usually stored in language files, typically in JSON format. Each translation string is associated with a unique key that is used to retrieve the translated content. These language files are organized based on the supported languages, allowing the application to load the appropriate translations based on the user&#39;s language preference.</p><p>Maintaining translated content requires regular updates to language files whenever new features are added or existing ones are modified. This ensures that translations remain accurate and up to date, providing a seamless experience for users across different languages.</p><h2 id="Identifying-Missing-Translations"><a href="#Identifying-Missing-Translations" class="headerlink" title="Identifying Missing Translations"></a>Identifying Missing Translations</h2><p>Before addressing missing translations, it&#39;s crucial to identify them. There are several techniques you can employ to detect untranslated content in your application. One effective approach is to enable i18next&#39;s debug mode, which logs warnings for missing translations in the browser&#39;s console. By inspecting these warnings, you can quickly identify the translation keys that require attention.</p><p>Additionally, thorough testing and quality assurance play a vital role in identifying missing translations. Test your application with different languages and carefully review the content for any untranslated strings. By following these practices, you can ensure that your application&#39;s translations are comprehensive and accurate.</p><h2 id="Strategies-to-Handle-Missing-Translations"><a href="#Strategies-to-Handle-Missing-Translations" class="headerlink" title="Strategies to Handle Missing Translations"></a>Strategies to Handle Missing Translations</h2><p>When it comes to handling missing translations, there are several strategies you can employ in your i18next workflow:</p><p><strong>1. Using Fallback Languages</strong>: To provide a default content for missing translations, you can utilize <a href="https://www.i18next.com/principles/fallback#language-fallback">fallback languages</a>. When a translation is missing for a specific key, i18next can automatically fallback to a default language and display the corresponding translation. This ensures that users still receive meaningful content even if a specific translation is unavailable.</p><p><strong>2. Implementing Placeholder Text (default value)</strong>: Another approach is to implement <a href="https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/essentials#passing-a-default-value">placeholder text</a> for untranslated content. This allows you to display temporary text or placeholders instead of leaving the content blank. Placeholder text can provide context to the user and give them an idea of what the translated content would be.</p><p><strong>3. Customizing Error Handling</strong>: i18next provides <a href="https://www.i18next.com/overview/configuration-options#missing-keys">customization options</a> for handling missing translations. You can define custom error handlers to display informative messages or alternative content when a translation is missing. This way, you can tailor the error handling to match your application&#39;s requirements and maintain a consistent user experience.</p><p><strong>4. Systematically Track Missing Translations: Leveraging Community and Machine Translation Services</strong>: When facing a large volume of translations or time constraints, leveraging community translation platforms or machine translation services can be beneficial. Platforms like locize enable collaboration with translators, making it easier to manage and update translations. Additionally, with the <a href="https://www.i18next.com/overview/configuration-options#missing-keys"><code>saveMissing</code></a> feature in i18next, you can automatically save missing translations and leverage <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/auto-machine-translation">machine translation services</a> to provide initial translations that can later be refined by human translators. This is how such a workflow <a href="https://youtu.be/ds-yEEYP1Ks?t=578">may look like</a>.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/ds-yEEYP1Ks?t=578"><img src="auto-translate-missing.gif"></a></p><p>By implementing these strategies, you can ensure that your application gracefully handles missing translations, providing a seamless experience for users across different languages.</p><h2 id="Best-Practices-for-i18next-Localization-Workflow"><a href="#Best-Practices-for-i18next-Localization-Workflow" class="headerlink" title="Best Practices for i18next Localization Workflow"></a>Best Practices for i18next Localization Workflow</h2><p>To maintain a smooth localization workflow with i18next, it&#39;s important to follow some best practices:</p><p><strong>1. Establishing a Clear Translation Process</strong>: Define a clear process for managing translations, including <a href="https://docs.locize.com/guides-tips-and-tricks/keeping-track-of-new-translations">how and when translations are updated</a>. This ensures that translations remain accurate and up to date.</p><p><strong>2. Collaborating with Translators and Maintaining a Glossary</strong>: Establish effective communication channels with translators and maintain a <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/glossary">glossary of frequently used terms</a>. This promotes consistency and accuracy across translations.</p><p><strong>3. Consistent Formatting and Placeholders</strong>: Ensure that translations follow consistent <a href="../i18n-formats-javascript/#i18next">formatting</a> guidelines and utilize placeholders effectively. This helps maintain the layout and structure of your application across different languages.</p><p><strong>4. Version Control and Tracking Changes</strong>: Use some sort of <a href="https://docs.locize.com/more/versioning">versioning</a> and <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/history">history</a> capabilies to track changes in language files. This allows you to easily revert to previous translations if needed and track modifications over time.</p><p>By incorporating these best practices into your i18next localization workflow, you can streamline the translation process and maintain a high level of quality in your multilingual application.</p><h2 id="Improving-User-Experience"><a href="#Improving-User-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Improving User Experience"></a>Improving User Experience</h2><p>Handling missing translations not only involves providing alternative content but also focuses on enhancing the user experience.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="title.jpg"></p><p>As businesses expand their reach to global audiences, localization becomes crucial to ensure their message reaches the target market accurately. However, translating content accurately can be challenging, especially when context is not considered. In this article, we will explore the importance of context in localization and how some context features can help improve translation accuracy.</p><h2 id="Understanding-Context-in-Localization"><a href="#Understanding-Context-in-Localization" class="headerlink" title="Understanding Context in Localization"></a>Understanding Context in Localization</h2><p>Context plays a crucial role in accurately translating content. It refers to the circumstances, conditions, or background surrounding a word or phrase that contributes to its meaning. Without proper context, translators may misunderstand the intended message, leading to an inaccurate translation. Some situations where context is particularly important include idiomatic expressions, cultural references, and technical terms.</p><h3 id="Examples"><a href="#Examples" class="headerlink" title="Examples"></a>Examples</h3><p><strong>- Inaccurate translations:</strong> Without context, translators may misinterpret the meaning of a phrase, resulting in a less accurate translation. For example, if a software application has a button with the label &quot;ship&quot; a translator without context might translate it to German as &quot;Schiff&quot; <em>(large boat for transporting people)</em> instead of &quot;versenden&quot; <em>(send / transport)</em> leading to confusion for the user.</p><p><strong>- Cultural insensitivity:</strong> Without context, translations may be culturally insensitive or even offensive. For example, a literal translation of a phrase or idiom in one language may not make sense or be considered offensive in another language.</p><p><strong>- Inconsistent terminology:</strong> Without context, translators may use inconsistent terminology, resulting in confusion for users. For example, if a software application uses different terms to refer to the same feature in different parts of the application, users may have difficulty understanding how to use it.</p><p><strong>- Technical errors:</strong> Without context, translators may not have the technical knowledge necessary to accurately translate technical terms or phrases. For example, a translator may not understand the technical meaning of a term like &quot;cache&quot; and translate it as &quot;hidden storage&quot; leading to confusion for the user.</p><h2 id="Best-Practices-for-Using-locize-39-s-Context-Features"><a href="#Best-Practices-for-Using-locize-39-s-Context-Features" class="headerlink" title="Best Practices for Using locize&#39;s Context Features "></a>Best Practices for Using locize&#39;s Context Features <a name="context-features"></a></h2><p>Locize offers several powerful features to help improve translation accuracy: specific <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/context#context-information-per-key-segment">context information per segment</a>, <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/context#incontext-view">InContext view</a>, <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/glossary">terminology glossary</a>, and <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/context#screenshots">screenshot</a> feature.</p><p><a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/context#context-information-per-key-segment">Specific context information</a> allows users to add notes, links, and descriptions to provide additional context for each individual key/segment.<img src="key_context.png"></p><p>The <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/context#incontext-view">InContext view</a> enables users to connect content from their website directly with their content on their localization project on locize.<img src="incontext_editor.png"></p><p>The <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/glossary">glossary</a> is a lexica that contains terminology to be used or not be used in the translations.

However, it can be tough to know where to start when it comes to implementing a localization marketing strategy. </p><p>An older example, but still valid as it shows the importance of marketing localization, was that of Nokia. The company faced a major setback when introducing its <a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/nokias-lumia-means-um-prostitute-in-spanish/">Lumia phone in Spanish-speaking regions</a> due to the product&#39;s name being colloquially associated with the term &quot;prostitute&quot; in Spanish. </p><p>Today you are going to learn exactly how to avoid marketing-localization mistakes and how to implement a localization procedure in your business.</p><h2 id="Table-of-contents"><a href="#Table-of-contents" class="headerlink" title="Table of contents"></a>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#marketinglocalization">What is localization in marketing?</a></li><li><a href="#importance">Why is localization in global marketing important?</a></li><li><a href="#yourbusiness">How to implement marketing localization in your business</a></li><li><a href="#mistakes">Potential mistakes to avoid in global marketing localization</a></li><li><a href="#globalexamples">Exploring successful global marketing campaigns: Examples from known brands</a></li><li><a href="#measure">How to measure global marketing efforts</a></li><li><a href="#7steps">7 steps for marketers and project managers to effectively localize their marketing content</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-is-localization-in-marketing"><a href="#What-is-localization-in-marketing" class="headerlink" title="What is localization in marketing? "></a>What is localization in marketing? <a name="marketinglocalization"></a></h2><p>Simply put, localization in marketing is the process of adapting your marketing material to ensure that it meets the interests and needs of your various target markets. </p><p>Working across a global market means you will be interacting with different cultures and customer expectations. Being able to understand their needs will allow you to effectively translate your material and maximize your chances of converting leads into long-term customers. </p><h2 id="Why-is-localization-in-global-marketing-important"><a href="#Why-is-localization-in-global-marketing-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is localization in global marketing important? "></a>Why is localization in global marketing important? <a name="importance"></a></h2><p>Did you know that 50% of <a href="https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/global-ecommerce-statistics" title="online shoppers">online shoppers</a> purchase something from a company that is outside their home country? While globalization is a wonderful way to increase your business, competition is also incredibly tough. </p><p><a href="../localization/" title="Localization">Localization</a> will help to give your brand the edge by ensuring you are reaching customers in their native language. Localization is much more than just translation, though. It is about using the cultural idioms, phrases, and symbolism, helping to increase trust and overall satisfaction.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Process</th><th>Purpose</th><th>What is adapted</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Marketing Translation</td><td>Create marketing messages that resonate in other markets</td><td>Message (copy, text)</td></tr><tr><td>Marketing Localization</td><td>Create experiences that resonate in other markets</td><td>Message, visuals, UX elements</td></tr><tr><td>Localization Marketing</td><td>Leverage localization for growth through a digital marketing strategy</td><td>Systems and processes (to support the strategy)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="How-to-implement-marketing-localization-in-your-business"><a href="#How-to-implement-marketing-localization-in-your-business" class="headerlink" title="How to implement marketing localization in your business "></a>How to implement marketing localization in your business <a name="yourbusiness"></a></h2><p>Now we have answered the question, “what is localization in marketing?” it is time to look at how you can begin to implement it into your business. This can seem a daunting process, but there are several steps to remember:</p><p><strong>1. Hire the experts</strong><br>Working with professionals is one of the most important steps, as they will have a clear idea of your demographics, the language of your target audience, their culture, and the nuances that will make you sound like a local.</p><p><strong>2. Localize your website</strong><br>Alongside your marketing materials, you should also localize your website. <a href="https://www.english.com/blog/english-language-internet/">Over 75%</a> of the world’s population does not speak English, so failing to optimize your website for non-English speakers will significantly restrict your reach and sales. </p><p><strong>3. Humanize your brand</strong><br>Another vital aspect of your localization marketing strategy should be humanizing your brand. When potential customers see your brand engaging in their language, using cultural elements, popular slang and words in their products and services, they are far more likely to complete their purchase.</p><p><strong>4. Use local partners</strong><br>Influencers now play a major role in marketing campaigns for businesses across almost every industry. However, when it comes to localizing your marketing plan, you should look at the partners you are operating with and adapt accordingly to influencers in the local market. </p><h2 id="Potential-mistakes-to-avoid-in-global-marketing-localization"><a href="#Potential-mistakes-to-avoid-in-global-marketing-localization" class="headerlink" title="Potential mistakes to avoid in global marketing localization "></a>Potential mistakes to avoid in global marketing localization <a name="mistakes"></a></h2><p>Despite its importance, there are many common mistakes that organizations make in their localization strategy, including:</p><p><strong>Focusing on a universal approach</strong>One of the most common mistakes is adopting a universal approach. Effective localization is not a one-size-fits-all and requires careful tailoring to ensure your brand is reaching the most effective touch points of your target market.</p><p><strong>Not localizing every aspect</strong>Another common mistake is only localizing certain aspects, such as print advertising. Neglecting certain areas, such as your socials or website, can lead to customers heading elsewhere. </p><p><strong>Poor translation</strong> Poor translation is another common mistake when it comes to marketing localization. Working with a professional localization partner will ensure that you are not using any embarrassing or incorrect phrasing. </p><p><a href="https://docs.locize.com/more/figma-plugin"><img src="prototyping-for-global-audience.webp" alt="Easily Create Prototypes for Multilingual Interfaces"></a></p><h2 id="Exploring-successful-global-marketing-campaigns-Examples-from-known-brands"><a href="#Exploring-successful-global-marketing-campaigns-Examples-from-known-brands" class="headerlink" title="Exploring successful global marketing campaigns: Examples from known brands "></a>Exploring successful global marketing campaigns: Examples from known brands <a name="globalexamples"></a></h2><p>Transcreation is a term used in the advertising and marketing industry to refer to the process of adapting a message from one language and culture to another while maintaining the intended emotion, tone, and context of the original message. </p><p>It goes beyond just translation as it involves the creative process of rewriting and adapting the message to fit the cultural and linguistic nuances of the target audience, while still conveying the same meaning and impact as the original message.</p><p>Transcreation is especially important for global marketing campaigns, where the same message needs to be conveyed across different languages and cultures. It allows companies to effectively communicate their brand message and values to a global audience, while also respecting the unique cultural differences and nuances of each region.</p><p>When done effectively, a global marketing campaign can transform a business and propel them onto success. Some great examples include:</p><p><strong>Red Bull</strong>One of the leading brands in the world, Red Bull can often feel like a local company. Their support of local sporting events, from F1 to Soapbox races, ensures they are continuously being placed in front of their relevant audience. </p><p><strong>Airbnb</strong> Since its launch in 2008, Airbnb has grown from its San Francisco base to become one of the most recognized businesses in the world. Its <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/made-possible-hosts-airbnb-linh-lai">“Made Possible By Hosts”</a> campaign brought the company into the homes of potential customers across the globe. </p><p><strong>McDonald’s</strong>The iconic golden arches of McDonald’s are recognized across the globe, and its marketing efforts are one of the best examples of localization. While the colors and themes remain similar, the fast food chain focuses on using region-specific menus; for instance, the use of flatbreads in the Middle East or Macaroons in France.  </p><h2 id="How-to-measure-global-marketing-efforts"><a href="#How-to-measure-global-marketing-efforts" class="headerlink" title="How to measure global marketing efforts "></a>How to measure global marketing efforts <a name="measure"></a></h2><p>While there can be no denying the benefits that come from marketing localization, it is vital that you are effectively measuring your results. </p><p>In order to determine your performance, you should first set yourself some clear goals of what you want to achieve and by when. This will act as your benchmark and will allow you to track whether you are on course to achieve them. </p><p>Of course, one of the biggest factors to consider is your ROI.</p><p>In this <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/07/a-refresher-on-marketing-roi" title="what is Marketing ROI-guide">&quot;what is Marketing ROI-guide&quot;</a> you will find more information about how to measure it.</p><p>This is a very effective method of understanding the efficiency of your global marketing efforts as there is a clear correlation between your activities and sales.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="title.jpg"></p><p>In today&#39;s globalized world, localization has become a vital factor in ensuring business success. Customers prefer to interact with products and services in their native language, and businesses need to adapt to this demand.With the emergence of Serverless Architectures, it has become easier for developers to build and deploy applications without worrying about infrastructure management. But how can businesses ensure that their serverless applications are multilingual? In this article, we&#39;ll explore the role of <a href="https://www.i18next.com/">i18next</a> and <a href="../tms/">TMS</a> in serverless architectures and how they can help businesses build and deploy multilingual serverless applications.</p><h2 id="What-is-Serverless-Architecture"><a href="#What-is-Serverless-Architecture" class="headerlink" title="What is Serverless Architecture?"></a>What is Serverless Architecture?</h2><p>Serverless architecture is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and automatically allocates resources as needed. It&#39;s a pay-per-use model, where businesses only pay for the actual usage of the application. Developers can focus on writing code and building applications without worrying about infrastructure management, scalability, and availability.</p><h2 id="What-is-i18next"><a href="#What-is-i18next" class="headerlink" title="What is i18next?"></a>What is i18next?</h2><p>i18next is an open-source internationalization framework for JavaScript that provides a complete solution for managing translations in web applications. It&#39;s lightweight and easy to integrate into serverless applications. i18next allows developers to organize translations into files, use interpolation, pluralization, and format translations based on the user&#39;s locale. i18next also has support for popular frontend frameworks such as <a href="../react-i18next/">React</a>, <a href="../angular-i18next/">Angular</a> and <a href="../i18next-vue/">Vue</a>, etc.</p><h2 id="The-Challenges-of-Multilingual-Serverless-Applications"><a href="#The-Challenges-of-Multilingual-Serverless-Applications" class="headerlink" title="The Challenges of Multilingual Serverless Applications"></a>The Challenges of Multilingual Serverless Applications</h2><p>One of the biggest challenges of building multilingual serverless applications is managing translations. Applications that are built for a global audience require content to be translated into multiple languages. Manually managing translations can be a daunting task, as it involves managing multiple translation files, keeping track of translations, and ensuring consistency across languages. Additionally, deploying multiple versions of the application for each language can be a logistical nightmare, especially if you have to manage multiple tiny parts like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> functions.</p><p>For classic web applications, you usually have 2 parts where internationalization tasks occur: The client side (usually some modern single page app) and the server side.The translation resources are usually stored in the same place, so that the client and the server can read them. In case of i18next, the client can access them useing <a href="https://github.com/i18next/i18next-http-backend">i18next-http-backend</a> and the server can access them using <a href="https://github.com/i18next/i18next-fs-backend">i18next-fs-backend</a>.</p><ul><li><a href="../react-i18next/#separate">Here</a> is an example of what this might look like on the client side.</li><li><a href="../how-does-server-side-internationalization-look-like/#pug">Here</a> for an example of how this could look on the server side.</li></ul><p>But for serverless environments, you may have multiple clients, and you may have multiple small serverless functions that respond to a request in the appropriate language, or send some emails in the user&#39;s preferred language, and so on.</p><h2 id="Serverless-E-Mails"><a href="#Serverless-E-Mails" class="headerlink" title="Serverless E-Mails"></a>Serverless E-Mails</h2><p>Let&#39;s think about a serverless function that generates and sends some emails.For example we want to send an invitation to someone.We need the email address, the recipient&#39;s preferred language, an email template and some translations.</p><p>To achieve this goal, you usually need to transform some raw data into html content (or text) to be displayed in the user&#39;s preferred language.</p><p>In this example we will use <a href="https://pugjs.org/">pug</a> (formerly known as &quot;Jade&quot;, and also originally created by <a href="https://twitter.com/tjholowaychuk">TJ Holowaychuk</a>) to define some templates that should be filled with the data needed in the email, and <a href="https://mjml.io/">mjml</a> to actually design the email content.</p><p>Let&#39;s create a new <code>mail.js</code> file, which we can use, to accomplish this.</p><figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> pug <span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="string">&#x27;pug&#x27;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> mjml2html <span class="keyword">from</span> <span class="string">&#x27;mjml&#x27;</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">export</span> <span class="keyword">default</span> (data) =&gt;

But what about managing of all those translation files in these different serverless functions and also in the different clients?There&#39;s no central location anymore - it&#39;s all distributed.<br />We need a solution for that! We need a <a href="../i18n-l10n-t9n-tms/">Translation Management System</a>.</p><p>A Translation Management System (<a href="../tms/">TMS</a>) is a software platform that enables businesses to manage their translation workflow. It provides a central repository for storing translations and enables collaboration between translators. When integrated with i18next, TMS such as <a href="/">locize</a> can streamline the localization process in a serverless architecture. Here are some of the benefits of using a TMS integrated with i18next in a serverless architecture:</p><h3 id="Automatic-updates-of-translations"><a href="#Automatic-updates-of-translations" class="headerlink" title="Automatic updates of translations"></a>Automatic updates of translations</h3><p>When using a TMS, translations can be automatically updated whenever a new language is added or an existing translation is changed. This eliminates the need to manually update the translations in the codebase, which can be a time-consuming task.</p><h3 id="Improved-scalability"><a href="#Improved-scalability" class="headerlink" title="Improved scalability"></a>Improved scalability</h3><p>A TMS can handle translation requests from multiple applications and languages, making it easy to scale the localization process. By integrating a TMS with i18next, businesses can easily manage translations for multiple applications without worrying about the scalability of the translation process.</p><h3 id="Reduced-costs"><a href="#Reduced-costs" class="headerlink" title="Reduced costs"></a>Reduced costs</h3><p>By using a TMS, businesses can reduce the cost of managing translations. A TMS provides a central repository for storing translations, eliminating the need to manage translations in multiple codebases.

By using a TMS integrated with i18next, businesses can ensure that their translations are stored securely and are only accessible by authorized personnel.</p><h2 id="Implementing-Possible-Approaches-for-TMS-with-i18next"><a href="#Implementing-Possible-Approaches-for-TMS-with-i18next" class="headerlink" title="Implementing Possible Approaches for TMS with i18next"></a>Implementing Possible Approaches for TMS with i18next</h2><h3 id="Client-side"><a href="#Client-side" class="headerlink" title="Client side"></a>Client side</h3><p>For the client side it&#39;s that we can go full steam ahead. We can live download the translations on demand directly from the <a href="https://docs.locize.com/whats-inside/cdn-content-delivery-network">locize CDN</a>. This way we can change translations or add new languages directly in locize without having to modify or redeploy the client app.</p><p>In addition, we can unleash a lot of extra features to speed up the localization process. For example:</p><ul><li>We can use the <a href="../i18next-migrate/#save-missing">saveMissing</a> feature to add new keys and automatically translate them with machine translation.</li><li>We can <a href="https://docs.locize.com/guides-tips-and-tricks/unused-translations">find and filter</a> in locize which keys are used or not used anymore, thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/locize/locize-lastused">last-used</a> plugin.</li><li>We can find and edit translations directly in the <a href="https://docs.locize.com/more/incontext-editor">In-Context editor</a>.</li></ul><p>Have a look at <a href="../react-i18next/">this tutorial</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/jeRxew3OV64">this video</a> to just see just a few of these cool things.</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jeRxew3OV64" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><h3 id="Server-less-side"><a href="#Server-less-side" class="headerlink" title="Server(less) side"></a>Server(less) side</h3><p>For the serverless side we could trigger a new serverless deployment every time a new <a href="https://docs.locize.com/more/versioning">translation version</a> is published.

"></a>What is mobile app localization? <a name="what"></a></h2><p>In this highly connected digital world, globalization is an essential part of any business. Being able to effectively reach and engage with customers around the world is crucial, especially for mobile app developers. </p><p>With the rise of smartphones, apps have become a core part of our daily lives. From ordering food to watching films, research has shown that over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/271644/worldwide-free-and-paid-mobile-app-store-downloads/" title="230 billion mobile apps">230 billion mobile apps</a>  were downloaded in 2021 alone. </p><p>This extensive use means localization of an app is crucial in ensuring your products can reach consumers anywhere in the world. What is this localization, though, and how can it help?</p><h2 id="Make-your-app-scalable-with-localization"><a href="#Make-your-app-scalable-with-localization" class="headerlink" title="Make your app scalable with localization "></a>Make your app scalable with localization <a name="scale"></a></h2><p>Mobile-app-localization is a highly beneficial aspect of any business. This is a unique process that requires you to adapt your app so that it can be used by consumers in a wide range of localities. </p><p>This could require adapting the wording so that it is in the right language, or even changing the layout to suit the target market. With nearly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/274774/forecast-of-mobile-phone-users-worldwide/">five billion smartphone users</a> in the world, the localization of apps ensures that your product can be enjoyed by customers no matter where they might be located. </p><p><img src="smartphone-users.webp" alt="five billion smartphone users" title="five billion smartphone users"></p><h2 id="What-is-the-difference-between-localization-and-internationalization"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-localization-and-internationalization" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between localization and internationalization? "></a>What is the difference between localization and internationalization? <a name="term"></a></h2><p>Localization and internationalization are two vital strategies for any business, but many people often confuse the two. While they are two similar methods and both rely on each other, they do have two very different approaches. </p><p>Internationalization is the process of adapting your mobile app code so that it can be easily modified and adapted into the required language. On the other hand, localization is the process of actually customizing the content so that it meets the expectations of the chosen destination. </p><p>This means that internationalization needs to happen first, ensuring that mobile app coding is ready to meet the adaptations of localization. </p><p>Find out more about internationalization in our guide on <a href="../what-is-i18n/" title="what is i18n">what is i18n</a>.</p><p>You can&#39;t wait to see how others did it.

"></a>What is the process of localization? <a name="process"></a></h2><p>While there can be no denying the many benefits that come from localization, it is a comprehensive and time-consuming task. To help you, we have taken a closer look at the process:</p><h3 id="1-Planning"><a href="#1-Planning" class="headerlink" title="1)      Planning"></a>1)      Planning</h3><p>The first stage of any localization strategy is to ensure that you focus on your planning.This process should cover:</p><ul>  <li>deciding which countries and regions to target with your app localization efforts.</li>   <li> the research into the languages you are looking to focus on, how you will do this, and what requirements are needed to successfully meet the demands of your target audience.</li> </ul><h3 id="2-Execution"><a href="#2-Execution" class="headerlink" title="2)      Execution"></a>2)      Execution</h3><p>Once you have comprehensively planned your <a href="/blog/localization-strategy" title="localization strategy">localization strategy</a> for the app, the next step is to execute the changes. This should be taken with the utmost care and attention, carefully working through every aspect and feature of the app to ensure that they are meeting the requirements. </p><p>Here are some examples: </p><ul>  <li>Translate your app's title, description, and keywords into the target language to improve visibility and search ranking in local app stores.</li>   <li>Adapt your app's screenshots and videos to better fit the cultural preferences and expectations of local users.</li> </ul><p><a href="#appstore">The coming chapter</a> gives you the full list of potential optimizations for a mobile app.</p><h3 id="3-Testing"><a href="#3-Testing" class="headerlink" title="3)      Testing"></a>3)      Testing</h3><p>With the translations made, you need to ensure that you are conducting a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure that it meets the exact requirements of your target audience.  A beta test is the most effective way of doing this. </p><p>Beta testing is the process of having the app reviewed by native speakers of your target demographics, having them review the copy and design. This should not be rushed, and you should be methodical with your beta testing to guarantee the very best result. </p><ul>  <li style="padding: 1rem 0">Test your app with real users in your area, and ask them to give you feedback on the localization as they use it.</li>   <li style="padding: 1rem 0">Verify text and character encoding to ensure that everything is accurately encoded and shown on all devices.</li>   <li style="padding: 1rem 0">Verify linguistic and cultural consistency: Make sure that all app components, including text, graphics, and sounds, are suitable from a culture standpoint and adhere to regional norms.</li>   <li style="padding: 1rem 0">Test the language switching capability of the app to ensure that users can quickly and simply switch between languages.</li> </ul><p>Including an in-app feedback feature can be very beneficial, with research showing that it can increase feedback by <a href="https://instabug.com/blog/benefits-of-in-app-feedback-during-beta-testing/?src=InstabugBlog&mdm=internal&ref=mobile_app_localization" title="up to 750%">up to 750%</a>.</p><h3 id="4-Publish-your-updates"><a href="#4-Publish-your-updates" class="headerlink" title="4)      Publish your updates"></a>4)      Publish your updates</h3><p>Once your beta tests have been completed, it is time to publish your updates. This is the final step to getting your mobile app out there and being used by consumers. </p><h3 id="5-Bonus-tip-–-read-customer-reviews-and-check-analytics-data"><a href="#5-Bonus-tip-–-read-customer-reviews-and-check-analytics-data" class="headerlink" title="5)      Bonus tip – read customer reviews and check analytics data"></a>5)      Bonus tip – read customer reviews and check analytics data</h3><p>Of course, there is no better way to ensure that your app is the very best it can be than by reading customer reviews. This is your chance to see exactly what customers are thinking, allowing you to adapt the app accordingly. </p><p>Your app analytics are an excellent location to look for potential growth directions.

There are several tips to remember when finding a translator, including:<h4 id="1-Background"><a href="#1-Background" class="headerlink" title="1)      Background"></a>1)      Background</h4><p>The first thing to do is to review their background. You want to ensure that your chosen translator has a proven history in your target language, either being a native speaker or has spent considerable time in that country. </p><h4 id="2-Be-clear"><a href="#2-Be-clear" class="headerlink" title="2)      Be clear"></a>2)      Be clear</h4><p>When engaging with a translator, you should make sure that you are as clear and straightforward as possible. The more thorough you are with your instructions, the better your translator will be able to understand your requirements. </p><h4 id="3-Ask-for-examples"><a href="#3-Ask-for-examples" class="headerlink" title="3)      Ask for examples"></a>3)      Ask for examples</h4><p>Another top tip when it comes to finding the very best translator possible is to ask for examples.

In this article, we will examine the technology behind Google Translate, its limitations, real-life examples, effective and efficient use, and ethical and privacy concerns related to the use of machine translation services.</p><h2 id="The-Technology-Behind-Google-Translate"><a href="#The-Technology-Behind-Google-Translate" class="headerlink" title="The Technology Behind Google Translate"></a>The Technology Behind Google Translate</h2><p>Google Translate is a combination of machine learning algorithms and statistical models that translate text from one language to another. It uses statistical machine translation, which involves training the system on large amounts of parallel text data. This data is then used to identify patterns and relationships between words in different languages, allowing Google Translate to accurately translate text.</p><p>Google Translate is continually updated and improved, adding new language pairs and refining existing ones. The service also solicits user feedback and suggestions for improvement, which further improves its accuracy over time.</p><h2 id="The-Limitations-of-Google-Translate"><a href="#The-Limitations-of-Google-Translate" class="headerlink" title="The Limitations of Google Translate"></a>The Limitations of Google Translate</h2><p>Google Translate is a highly advanced machine translation system, but it is still limited by its technology and data. Some of the key limitations of Google Translate include:</p><ul>  <li>    <b>Lack of Context</b>: Google Translate heavily relies on the input text, which can lead to incorrect translations if it doesn't understand the context of a sentence. For example, the phrase "I'm falling for you" can be translated as "Estoy cayendo por ti" in Spanish, which can mean both "I am falling for you" and "I am falling physically".  </li>  <li>    <b>Ambiguity</b>: Words can often have ambiguous meanings, especially when translating between languages with different grammatical structures. This can result in translations that are inaccurate or convey a different meaning than intended. For example, the English word "bass" can mean a type of fish or a low-frequency sound, but both meanings have different translations in other languages.  </li>  <li>    <b>Cultural Differences</b>: Language is closely tied to culture, and cultural differences can impact the accuracy of Google Translate. For example, idioms and cultural references can be challenging to translate accurately. For instance, the English phrase "beating around the bush" cannot be translated accurately to some cultures who do not have similar idioms.  </li>  <li>    <b>Syntax Awareness</b>: Text used in <a href="../what-is-software-localization/">software localization</a> (<a href="../what-is-i18n/">internationalization</a>) often contains interpolation specific syntax - tags that are specific to the <a href="../i18n-formats-javascript/">i18n format</a> used. Google Translate often does not respect these syntax rules. More specific machine translation tools such as <a href="https://translate.i18next.com/" target="_blank">translate.i18next.com</a> or the more complete cat version of <a href="/" target="_blank">locize</a> are better suited to handle these types of use cases.  </li></ul><h2 id="Factors-That-Affect-Google-Translate-39-s-Accuracy"><a href="#Factors-That-Affect-Google-Translate-39-s-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="Factors That Affect Google Translate&#39;s Accuracy"></a>Factors That Affect Google Translate&#39;s Accuracy</h2><p>Several factors can impact the accuracy of Google Translate, including:</p><ul>  <li>    <b>Quality of Input Text</b>: The quality of the input text is critical in determining the accuracy of Google Translate. Poorly written text, with grammatical errors and typos, can result in incorrect translations.  </li>  <li>    <b>Domain-Specific Terminology</b>: Google Translate is trained on a broad range of text data, but it may struggle to accurately translate domain-specific terminology. For example, technical terms in medicine or law can be challenging to translate.  </li>  <li>    <b>User Feedback</b>: Google Translate invites user feedback and suggestions for improvement, which can impact its accuracy over time. The more feedback it receives, the better it can become at translating text in a specific language or domain.  </li></ul><h2 id="Effective-and-Efficient-Usage-of-Google-Translate"><a href="#Effective-and-Efficient-Usage-of-Google-Translate" class="headerlink" title="Effective and Efficient Usage of Google Translate"></a>Effective and Efficient Usage of Google Translate</h2><p>Google Translate can be a highly effective and efficient tool for translating text, but it&#39;s important to use it properly to get the best results. Here are some tips for using Google Translate effectively and efficiently:</p><ol>  <li>    <b>Use proper input text</b>: As mentioned earlier, the quality of the input text is critical in determining the accuracy of Google Translate. Ensure that the text is well-written and free of grammatical errors and typos to get the most accurate translation possible.  </li>  <li>    <b>Use specific language pairs</b>: Google Translate supports many language pairs, but it is always better to use the language pair with the highest accuracy rate. For instance, if you are translating from English to Spanish, it's better to use English to Spanish rather than English to French to Spanish.  </li>  <li>    <b>Consider the context</b>: Google Translate heavily relies on the input text and may not always understand the context of a sentence. If possible, provide additional context to ensure that the translation is accurate.  </li>  <li>    <b>Check for cultural references</b>: Language is closely tied to culture, and cultural references can impact the accuracy of Google Translate. Always check for cultural references and idioms before relying on the translation.  </li>  <li>    <b>Utilize user feedback</b>: Google Translate invites user feedback and suggestions for improvement, which can impact its accuracy over time. If you come across a translation that is not accurate, you can provide feedback to help improve the service for everyone.  </li>  <li>    <b>Use it for general understanding</b>: Google Translate is not suitable for professional or critical translations but can be very helpful for understanding the general meaning of a text in a foreign language.  </li></ol><p>By following these tips, you can get the most out of your experience with Google Translate and ensure that your translations are as accurate and reliable as possible.</p><h2 id="Ethical-and-Privacy-Concerns-of-Machine-Translation-Services"><a href="#Ethical-and-Privacy-Concerns-of-Machine-Translation-Services" class="headerlink" title="Ethical and Privacy Concerns of Machine Translation Services"></a>Ethical and Privacy Concerns of Machine Translation Services</h2><p>The use of machine translation services raises several ethical and privacy concerns that should be considered when using such tools.
